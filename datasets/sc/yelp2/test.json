We then ordered drinks, Javier had a margarita on the rocks, he loved it and was the perfect flavor and perfect amount of alcohol. We both then got the fajita lunch special, he got chicken with the flour tortillas and I got beef with corn tortillas. It came out in a small skillet but I think it was a perfect portion, I left not feeling too full. Javier on the other hand was too full. He ate the flour tortillas, which were very thick and looked like pancakes. I preffered the corn, not as filling and doesnt leave you stuffed. Im glad I tried this place, I will go back if Javier wanted to, but I wasnt impressed. I could make the same thing at home."

We were not disappointed!\\n\\nWe had the following dishes:\\nShiromi Carpaccio\\nYellowtail Ceviche\\nSeabass and Mushroom\\nPanko Fried Soft Shell Crab Sandwich\\nPork Belly Buns\\n\\nThe Shiromi Carpaccio was basically a white fish with they poured this heavenly hot sesame oil with ginger yuzo and garlic all over the fish just before serving. The sesame oil lightly cooked the fish and it was sublime. It was served with homemade focaccia bread and we liked the focaccia bread so much we ordered more so we could dip it into the sauce. The Yellowtail Ceviche was served in Asian style spoons with sesame seed and shredded taro on top. It was a mouthful of flavorful goodness! The shredded taro was crispy and this added a nice texture. The Seabass and Mushrooms was unlike anything I've ever had before. It was baked in parchment paper with garlic butter, sake, and soy. The seabass was very very tender and almost melted in my mouth. The mushrooms were just succulent. I would say the Shiromi Carpaccio, the Yellowtail Ceviche, and the Seabass and Mushrooms were my favorite dishes. \\n\\nThe Panko Fried Soft Shell Crab Sandwich was very good with housemade focaccia and kanzuri aioli. It all tasted very fresh. It was very filling and I really liked the crunchy texture of the crab. The Pork Belly Buns with braised pork belly, pickled mustard greens were tasty and also very filling. I loved the chewy flavorful goodness of the pork belly. \\n\\nMy husband and I ordered 5 things and we honestly couldn't finish everything. We were so full and happy! I also had a very good flower tea that I enjoyed. My husband ordered a beer that he had never heard of and enjoyed it immensely. \\n\\nThe atmosphere is quaint. Nobuo is intimate and quiet in a little old house and you can tell they put a lot of thought into the decor. It's the perfect place for a date. \\n\\nI was quite impressed with both the food and the service and the chef even came out of the kitchen to shake our hands and say hello. I would highly recommend Nobuo if you are looking for an upscale, quiet meal, with awesome food and service. I hardly ever come to Phoenix because I'm from Cali but I will make a point of coming back to Nobuo whenever I get a chance!!

Maybe part of it is having had much more sublime ice cream at places like Bi-Rite Creamery in San Francisco where the sometimes long wait is worth it. Or maybe because at a Baskin Robbins, I've never chewed on ice crystals while circumventing an ice cream scoop. I was out bike riding and happened upon what turned out to be Churn's opening day. The women behind the counter were extremely polite and patient as I sampled three flavors. I finally settled on blueberry. I was pretty surprised when I was handed my cup and the \\\"scoop\\\" looked more like 3/4 of a kiddie scoop. For $3?? It barely filled the cup half-way. \\n\\nWell, last weekend, a couple of friends and I had dinner at Windsor next door which we found quite yummy. My friends hadn't tried Churn so I went along with it. I sampled the peanut butter which, even the one spoonful was somehow very heavy. So I went with the tried and true vanilla. To my surprise, the scoop this time was what I would constitute as a regular scoop. Yes I got more, but the inconsistency kind of irked me. Halfway through the ice cream, I could hear and feel little ice crystals between my teeth. That tells me something is not totally right with their ice-cream making process. Also, I tasted more sugar and milk than vanilla bean flavor. Overall, the vanilla was just OK. \\n\\nI will happily go to Windsor any time but if someone suggests Churn, I may have to bow out. I don't wish the shop bad business. I like the interior decor, the festive displays of cookies, candy, etc.  I just don't feel the need to promote it to others."

Put it this way, how many chinese people do you see eating at PF Changs or Panda express?  The reason is because the food is made for a western palate.  At Madras, the food is all Indian all the time, and that is what is going to keep me coming back!  A great tip is that at the end of your meal when you are walking out, they have a bowl called Mukhwas, or basically \\\"mouth freshener.\\\"  The mix is cardamom, anise seed, and coconut candy, and one half spoon full in your hand that you put into your mouth really helps to sooth your stomach after the meal.

We also had a Yinzer sandwich (very good), cheese sticks (also a winner), and some beer -- big damn $3 Yeunglings.  And to top it off, as we were leaving, the owner ran out to stop us -- we left such a large tip that he thought we'd forgotten money.\\n\\nGreat food, cheap beer, attentive service -- what was not to love?  We were DEFINITELY coming back.\\n\\nWell, tonight we came back.  Whoops.\\n\\nThey were short-staffed; the bartender and the cook were the only people working.  But they weren't that busy -- about ten or so people in the bar, with two in the dining room when we sat down and four more seated about fifteen minutes after us.  The bartender came over to get us drinks, and assured us the cook would be right out to take our orders.\\n\\nThe cook didn't get the memo.

When he saw we hadn't been tended to yet, he graciously took our order -- another Yinzer sandwich, some cheese sticks, and some more of those delicious garlic parm wings.\\n\\nAnd then came the waiting.  And the waiting.  And the waiting.\\n\\nI repeat, the only other diners ahead of us were a couple who already had their food.  A handful of carryout orders got filled.  Yes, they were short-staffed, but it was clearly a slow night.\\n\\nWe could see the kitchen from where we were sitting.

We could see our sandwich spend a good fifteen minutes in various stages of assembly.\\n\\nThe other table of four seated after us was getting equally ignored.  One of the ladies complained into her phone that she was being held hostage.\\n\\nThe food arrived.  Eventually.  Most of it.  We got our sandwich -- now cold -- and our cheese sticks -- deep-fryer fresh! -- a good forty-five minutes after we ordered them, and well over an hour after we first sat down.  I repeat, nobody was ahead of us in the dining room when we sat.  The bartender advised us that the wings would be a few more minutes.\\n\\nBased on past experience, I estimated how long it would take them to bring us our check once we were finished, and asked for it immediately.\\n\\nAside from being cold, the sandwich was very tasty.  And the cheese sticks were as awesome as deep-fried cheese usually is.  We finished what food we had -- and there was still no sign of the wings.  \\n\\n\\\"How many more minutes are those wings going to take?\\\" I asked the bartender.

The store was totally out of my way, a big waste of time. I ended up getting something else, but it needed to be measured. NO ONE WAS AROUND. This other lady and I waited and waited.....nothing. Finally I went up to the front of the store to have the checkout person measure my material. She was very pleasant and quick to apologize for no one helping me.

Even on a Thursday night we understand a large party of 5 couples and some kids will have to wait a bit. That didn't bother me but waiting for a table that could comfortably fit 10 with chairs on the corners is kinda sad. The dining room was half empty. There were empty tables all around us and no other large parties. After trying to fit into the table(with one chair short) and realizing our elbows were in each other's sides only sitting there, I asked the host if there was any possible way to add a table. She came over and added one, not sure why they couldn't just do this to begin with but I give them the benefit of the doubt.\\n\\nThe food was good, not the best I've tasted and definitely a bit pricey but the Poke Tuna I got was fresh, it was drowning in a pool of some sort of sauce was strange but helped cut the spicy so I liked it. My husband enjoyed his Ramen, the broth was very good actually. Everyone else seemed to like their meals, despite the fact that the server felt the need to explain everything as if they might change their minds. This also happened when we ordered coffee, it was as if she thought if we knew it was a french press we wouldn't want it. Because of this it did take a very long time for us to get it. When I was brought mine she told me she would have to come back in a minute to press it down for me since it wasn't ready yet. After a few minutes and no sign of her I did it myself and had to tell her when she did come over and apologize that I was familiar with french press coffee and could handle it. The overall dinner service definitely dragged.\\n\\nThe most awkward part of the night came at the end when we were waiting for our checks after explaining we really truly didn't need dessert.(They brought ice cream with a candle for my 26 yr old brother anyway). A large group was seated near us and it seemed they had the same dilemma of too many people for too small of a table. They stood there very near us as a host and server gestured at our table and after a couple minutes walked them back to the front. A few minutes later(while we were still waiting on checks, nothing we could do to try to give up our table and believe me too many of us have worked in the service industry to be table hogs), they were brought back in and shown that the host had set up another table for 6 right next to the original table they were given. More gesturing and stink eyes shot in our direction, then the party went back out front and their original table was expanded to be longer. I'm not sure what the deal is with this place but large parties really shouldn't be that hard to figure out. Especially on a slow Thursday night. \\n\\nWe may try this place again for Happy Hour sushi but this trip just didn't do much for me considering we spend $40 without any sushi or alcoholic drinks. I wouldn't recommend this place for a large party unless you really enjoy sitting on each others laps and having the pace of meal drag because your sole server is obviously overwhelmed not to mention doesn't have much faith in the product."

I ordered the Roasted Chili Glaze wings and they were, BY FAR, the best I have ever had! The other guests in my party ordered the Hot, Honey, and Hoppy wings, and the Southwest Americana burger. I tried both of those, and they were delicious. The wings had a nice kick to them without being overwhelming and the burger was the same way. The goat cheese balanced out the gigantic, fried pepper perfectly. QUALITY ingredients and well sized portions. For the food only, I will be visiting again.\\n\\nNow for the reason I gave a 2-star rating. It was a busy afternoon because of the ASU vs U of A game, so I figured service might take a little longer than normal. However, the amount of time we waited and the lack of attention our waiter gave to us was not what it should have been even with it being busy.\\n\\nWe started off ordering beers and that came out to us at a reasonable time. Then our waiter, Scott, took our order. We put in for the wings, burgers, and an appetizer (chips and salsa) to start us off. After 10-12 minutes of waiting I started to look for Scott walking around the restaurant to grab his attention and ask for our chips, but he was no where to be found. And the few times I caught a glimpse of him walking around, he never visited our table. Our meal took about 18 minutes or so to come out, which was fine wit me, but he never gave us our appetizer or even acknowledged that he forgot it. \\n\\nAbout 10 minutes into dinner, one of my guest's wanted a refill for the beer but again, our waiter was no where around. When he finally came to our table about 3 minutes later, another one of my guest's asked for a water (that he forgot to bring from the beginning) and before the guest who wanted a beer could even ask, Scott walked away too fast to even get a word out. By that time, we just had our mind on getting the check. \\n\\nIt took another 10 minutes to get the check processed because Scott hadn't come back to get our check, so we gave it to another waitress to get it done. Overall, we felt like we were the guests shoved into the corner and forgotten about. In my opinion, there were not enough staff working for how many people were there. That could have attributed to the lack of service and minimal attention needed to serve our table."

Mine came with a breadlike object on top and when questioned, he said, it's a cracker stick, like that was okay. When I picked up the bowl and handed it back to him, he started to remove the crumbly stick, like that would now make my contaminated salad gluten free. Then, the crumbs fell into my daugher's Caprese salad, so both had to be reordered. My daughter's dish was not correct, nor was her pasta side, so they remade the pasta. Gluten free pasta cannot be al dente, but this was. I found a piece of non gluten free pasta mixed in with mine, leading me to suspect they make the gluten free with the regular pasta.

I loved what I read & the pics that I saw of the many upscale-type offerings + their unique presentations.  I was looking forward to trying this AYCE, as my expectations were based on high standards from similar previous buffet experiences at Bellagio, Wynn, & Paris.\\n \\nHowever, I was so disappointed in my dining experience at WS for the following reasons:\\n\\n- Changes in the buffet offerings.   Many of the buffet offerings were not reflective of early Yelp reviews/photos posted since it opened in Dec. 2010. Foods were at one time presented in unique eye-catching servers in small portions so that you could try as much as possible, i.e., samples in mini pots, serving spoons, & bowls. While there were a few creative servings, e.g., noodles in Chinese take-out containers, fried chicken in mini fryer baskets, & boiled peanuts in paper cones, most of the food items are in large serving trays; just grab a serving spoon& serve yourself, just as in any buffet. Perhaps it proved to be too labor-intensive to offer so many individualized portions. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/wicked-spoon-las-vegas?select=VkwXpPWxl7tN4yK8ETxjLA http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/wicked-spoon-las-vegas?select=J9VUSLI3495TZ2MFxhpgvA \\n\\n- Many of the foods were not palatable. For example, the Chinese roast pork had crispy skins, but they were so tough that they were inedible; the snow crab legs were served cold, & they were the tiniest crab legs that I have ever seen w/ more shell than meat. Food items were simply overcooked, dried out from standing under a warmer for a length of time, & just plain tasteless. (Must give WS credit though, for offering upscale items, e.g., bone marrow, blackened fish, mac & cheese bar, kale salad; but they also had many items similarly offered at other buffets, e.g., pizzas, breads, teri chicken, beef ribs, potatoes, etc.) http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/wicked-spoon-las-vegas?select=-D60mxtVvUjwZ68IBp0YhQ \\n\\n- No lines to get into the buffet.  The top buffets in Vegas always have long lines that zigzag like you're waiting for a ride in Disneyland.  We walked right in for dinner at 6pm on a Tuesday evening w/ no lines whatsoever.  The dining room was not crowded. There apparently wasn't a demand for this buffet.\\n\\n- Buy one get one free offer was not available. Prior to leaving for Vegas, the local newspaper had an article re United Airlines offering a BOGO coupon for the WS on its Vegas flights; Yelp reviews also made mention of it. As I was flying on UAL, I asked the flight attendant on the Vegas leg re the coupon, & she/other attendants didn't know anything about it; never got the coupon. While we were at WS, I asked the manager, who said that the coupons were given out on only certain flights, such as those coming from Newark, NJ, but he was uncertain as to which flights. Although we had our UAL boarding passes, he said he could not honor those & could only honor the coupons if we had them. Then he told me to bring this to the attention of UAL, as they should clarify as to which flights had the coupons, while thanking me for bringing this to his attention so that he could alert his marketing people. \\n\\nYou would think that giving one BOGO coupon as a goodwill gesture would hardly make a dent in its profits. No deal.  Plus, wonder why they're even giving BOGO coupons - is it because there's no longer the demand of people flocking to it?\\n\\n- The price is high considering what you get. We paid $38/person for dinner on a weekday night ($47 on weekends). While the service is adequate, the quality of the food items does not justify this price. \\n\\nThe saving grace for this buffet is its dessert station.  They had a wonderful gelato/sorbet bar (loved the Thai iced tea & salted peanut caramel flavors) & heavenly huge chocolate-covered strawberries garnished w/ oreo cookie bits or Heath crunch bits. The extensive dessert station included chocolate molten lava cakes, pretty decorated cakes, raspberry/chocolate coffee rice krispy treats, red velvet cookies, parfaits, apple strudel, panna cotta, white chocolate mousse cones, macarons, etc.  Most of the desserts were excellent, but I would not pay $38 just to eat their desserts. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/wicked-spoon-las-vegas?select=6PSAjVXFwaLgYS3mN4I30Q  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/wicked-spoon-las-vegas?select=m4V11SUeP5XB1V3q9j_WNg \\n \\nAt least I can say I've dined here.

These guys looked like they were in grade school. Effecient but dry, not friendly. We weren't brought or even offered a bread basket despite ordering a full dinner. Sorry but that is weak. We also saw amd heard some animated bickering between a female bartender and a server. The short chubby GM guy who has been there awhile watched it from afar without stopping it or letting them know this type of behavior was unacceptable.  This GM seems to have gotten complacent in his job.  If i were a higher up in PUCK enterprises, id give this guy a dressing down or a demotion. This is not the Spago i once knew.\\n\\nYet make no mistake. The food is still great. Executive chef Eric Klein has put the Puck staple Chinois Chicken salad on the spring 2013 menu and this salad is as good as any you will eat. The Hong Kong stlyle Salmon was excellent.

Strange, because there were people cleaning rooms on our floor.  Just not ours, apparently.  \\n\\nAdditionally, the closet door was broken and one of the outlets had been pushed through the drywall.

Classy.\\n\\nNONE of the speed-dial buttons on our phone worked except for room service (Eventually we were told, \\\"Yeah, they don't work.

Um.  No.  We were very up-front with the management and received a small amount of compensation but the number of people I had to talk to get anything done was just insane and at the end of it, the compensation I was promised was not what was delivered.  Sigh.\\n\\nClearly whoever owns this property is waiting for it to die so that they can put a giant fake-fancy \\\"luxury\\\" hotel in its place.\\n\\nIt's really too bad.

Going to Vegas and having our Sunday night free we decided to go to the Freakling Brothers Trilogy Of Terror for some Halloween fun. \\n\\nFrom the outside all 3 look like some sort of carnival setup or something that you see victims go into and never come out of. I never imagined that the houses were made with trailers hooked up because for me it is as real and as good as some of the best haunts I've been to.  All 3 were really well done. I don't want to give away any details. If you go be sure to buy the VIP front of the line pass. Plus you get a tshirt all of an extra $10 not bad.\\n\\nWe started out with Circus of Terror. Let me say that even the ticket takers are dressed up and before you go in a ringmaster asks us if we want to go inside and gives us the rules. Once we set foot inside I was amazed that each one was so detailed so dark and twisted in it's own way. I don't want to give away anything. There are rooms where something happens and rooms where \\\"you have to figure out what to do\\\". Let's say the ending is something I won't ever forget.\\n\\nWe then went into Castle Vampyre. Igor took our tickets and the vampire lady told us the rules and made sure we wanted to go inside. Again it is dark and twisted. This was my favorite out of all 3 of them. There were rooms we had to figure out what to do and some effects that made me stop for a moment because I really thought I had to use \\\"the rope\\\" to go across. The ending had me standing there in awe just watching more than being scared. \\n\\nThe final house we went thru was the Gates of Hell. This one you have to sign a waiver because it is R rated and no one under 17 are admitted. I admit I was pretty freaked out because I found out about one of the things they do but I was fine inside. This one you have a \\\"safe word\\\" similar to Knott's Trapped. But unlike Trapped this is very and I mean VERY intense. YOU are definitely touched, shoved, called names, there is profanity. We ran into a group 2 girls in front of us because they couldn't find their way. Definitely had to use my hands to navigate thru several times it was that dark. The ending really well done. \\n\\nI can't imagine \\\"The Victim Experience\\\". Just the normal one was intense enough for me. I wanted to say the safe word but managed to get thru the entire experience. One that I won't ever forget.\\n\\nThe pictures they take when you first arrive are top quality and the price isn't bad. We bought 4 of them as a keepsake. Now nothing I do for Halloween will compare to being traumatized by the Freakling Brothers Trilogy Of Terror. Hopefully I will be back in the future.\\n\\nIf you haven't gone and live nearby it's definitely worth it."

The size 4 gown was also had what appeared to be a misshaped torso area which gave me a terrible stomach pooch.

I was thinking they brought me the wrong item but when I didn't eat my dough, the waiter said \\\"You don't like your shrimp dumpling?\\\" I didn't have the heart (or the energy after a long day of travel) to say anything except \\\"I want to have room for my Pad Thai\\\".  So, I awaited my Chicken Pad Thai hoping it was what I am used to.\\n\\nThe Pad Thai wasn't bad...not great, but not bad.  Once in a while, I got the taste of mayonaisse but I was starving at this point and it did the trick.  i actually took it back to my hotel for lunch the next day but decided in the morning that the taste wasn't worth the risk of Pad Thai all over my rental car.\\n\\nI'm not sure if I'll go back to Thai House.  i will certainly look for an alternative next time I'm in town.  If I'm starved and can't find any other place, I'll probably give Thai House another shot...I'll just stay away from anything that says \\\"dumpling\\\"."

After 2 hours we starting after questions about the wait?? Let me mention that even the bartenders were confused on our extremely long wait at this point.  After having visiting the hostess stand a few times, at 3 hours I went to ask, \\\"Whats up\\\", all because we had notice people who arrived after us being seated, Not good right!  Actually one of the groups that came in after my group was a gentlemen from my work, so when they got seated immediately I ask WHY? I was told that was a personal friend of Chris Bianco's.  Well, it was also a co-worker of mine.  An any account, to seat them (personal friends or not) before my group, who now having been waiting for 3 hours is NOT right, NOT a good business practice.  As I proceeded to inform the hostess of my concerns, Chris Bianco himself came out to inform me that it is his restaurant and he can seat who ever he wants, whenever he wants, and I might mention his voice was inappropriately loud and rude.  Well, being in the hospitality industry for 25 years, I could not help but to express my dissatisfaction, as you might image.  As my group decided to leave, Chris Bianco and 3 of his male employees followed us out of the restaurant, yelling and screaming at us, with foul language.  I was SHOCKED! In my life I have never had such a HORRIBLE experience!

Last night I found out that I'm excused from the jury duty so I called him around 5:00ish and asked him if it's possible to come the next morning, he answered and he said that he didn't have his schedules with him but he's d call me back in an hour and let me know.

This morning around 10:30ish I called and asked him again if he found out about his today's schedule, he said he's surprised that no one got back with me last night (I didn't know who else he's talking about),  he said that he can come this afternoon but he has to charge me extra because he just received an email this morning from Living social that the email told him to charge me a trip fee because my house is outside the distance limit, the limit is 25 miles but my house is 32 miles away.

How wrong I was.  \\n\\nAt first glance, the place looks impressive with quirky, fun decor. But it's all about the details, isn't it?  While the room was well furnished and large, the phone didn't work at all through the entire stay (and nobody came to fix it after maintenance made an appearance on day 1). So every time we needed anything, we had to go down to the front desk (see detail on staff attitude later in this review).  In addition, the beds were like wooden planks. \\n\\nAnd the breakfast was AWFUL.  Food two of the days was only partially cooked and inedible.  I'd upgraded our initial rate to include a full breakfast as part of a NYE package -- the upgrade cost about $100 US for two guests for three days.  But when we got to the cafe we were told our package only included the continental choice and we'd have to pay extra for additional items.  Seriously ... that is expensive bread and pastry (which I don't even eat).  So the desk manager (I assume that was his title), after a discussion, told me he was only upgrading our breakfast package to include meat to keep me happy (delivered in a very snide tone and smirk -- complete with eye roll).\\n\\nWhich brings us to the hotel staff.  Most importantly to me, about 50 percent of staff was extremely rude -- beyond the norm of European travel. I can tolerate a little bit of sassy attitude, but this was shockingly insulting.\\n\\nLastly, I'd paid in full two months in advance of the stay only to be presented a bill for 10 percent more at checkout. The girl at the desk could not explain it, only point to line items and shrug.  I'm still not sure why I was charged the additional fee (probably a malicious mark-up for the inedible breakfast) ... I'll probably never know.\\n\\nI should have followed my instincts initially and booked the Balmoral.

There was absolutely nothing Hawaiian about it. \\n\\nI ordered a Hula burger on wheat, like a mushroom swiss + extra charge for avocado ($8 + 1).

He wanted his burger rare, but our waitress told us they don't go less than medium. Hold the phone. Why is this? It takes less effort to cook a burger rare. Because you cook it less. So why in Zeus' name can't they cook it less? We didn't make a big deal, beyond the Zeus speech and he just got it medium. \\n\\nWhen I looked at his burger, I couldn't tell the difference between the wheat bread and the thoroughly-cooked beef. Brown brown brown. \\n\\nMy burger was good. But if you screw up a veggie burger, you need to kill yourself. My burger smelled so buttery.

There's a part of me that enjoys mushy burgers. I ended up having to eat it with a knife and fork in the end. Its like the middle of the cinnamon bun, all messy, but that's where the biggest concentration of flavor is. Oh, yeah, and I eat my burgers in concentric circles. \\n\\nThe fries. A travesty to fried foods. They were like greenish. They were thicker than shoestring and flavorless and dry. But they're not cooked in lard and have no trans fats. Honestly, if I'm eating fries, they better be cooked in lard and taste like pig guts and I don't care about the trans fats. They're french fries goddamnit. Not jicama. \\n\\nThere's a little table tent advertising about how their wonderful fries now come with the burgers. Because they can't sell them any more.

I raised 4 kids did many ER visits and this was the first time I had ever needed to go.   I had a colonoscopy there on Monday, the next day I started bleeding non stop.  I ended up in the ER because I was beginning to lose consciousness.  Failure #1, I went to the triage desk and told the nurse my Dr. sent me here because I was bleeding and was about to pass out.  She gave me papers to fill out and sent me to the lobby.  I couldn't even sit up or I would get dizzy.  When my wife completed the paper work she called us back to her cubby hole and tried to get a blood pressure, she couldn't.  I told her 3 different times I was going to pass out and her response was \\\"Let's get your temperature\\\".  At that point I passed out and passed blood all over the floor.  Thank god my wife was there to catch me or I might have had a head injury to go with my bleeding.  When I started to come to I was on a gurney in a ER stall.  I could hear people talking.  The Dr. was asking for a blood pressure but they couldn't get one.  I knew I was alive because I could see the EKG monitor and I had a heart beat.  They started 2 I.V's,  one in each arm which made me freezing cold.  When they did finally get a blood pressure it was 58/44. I saw the nurse one more time after that.\\nFailure #2. A little while later the Dr. came back in, and this was the last time I saw him, and said I had a vasovagal reaction from seeing my own blood.  What Dominican Republic Med School did he go to.  My Hemoglobin went from 15.9 and dropped to 9.2.  A drop of 40%.  Maybe, just maybe that might be the issue of passing out.\\nFailure #3.  The gastroenterologist came by and ordered me to have a CT of the Abdomen and 2 fleets enemas to clean me out so he could see where I was bleeding from, while we waited for the colonoscopy team to come in.  The hour or so we waited for them to come in, nothing was done.  When my Dr. asked if they did the enemas, I told him no.  In disgust, he said to the team, \\\"this is going to be messy\\\".  They asked me to roll on my side and I asked if I should take my shorts off, which I had been laying in for the past 2 1/2 hours covered in blood.  The nurse just shook her head.\\nFailure #4.  I was admitted for 3 days until my blood pressure would come back up.  With an I.V. in each arm they kept me on fluids.  They only used the left arm to put the fluids in.  Never flushed the right I.V. the entire time I was there.   When it was time to go home, they removed both I.V.'s.  This is where the failure comes in.  2 days later my arm was hurting and the vein was huge and tender.  A clot had formed in the right arm where the I.V. was.  I was instructed to take aspirin and apply heat to the area and it should go away.  Well, it never did and now the vein which was as large as a pencil is now a shriveled up hard vein the size of a pencil lead and useless.\\nThese were just the main blunders of the hospital, I guess I should be thankful I made it out alive.

I will take my chances of the 20 minute drive to Las Vegas to receive any care.\\nTo be honest, the nurses on the floor were very friendly.

They could not have overcooked the vegetables, shrimp, and fish more.  It was greasy, bland, insipid cooking that could not have been made better even if it were served with a diamond ring.

All that stuff must have been at the other Flancer's location, because this location didn't look like it even had taps or a bar.  My husband ordered an imperial IPA from New Belgium that he thought was pretty good (in a bottle) and I ordered the prickly pear spiked lemonade.  There was not much prickly pear flavor, but you could tell the lemonade itself was fresh squeezed.  \\n\\nThe sandwiches were the real highlight of our visit.  I got a sandwich with pork, arugula, tomato relish and onions.  It was amazing!  The bread was incredibly soft, but it still had a chewy outer coating so the sandwich didn't fall apart.  My husband got the Philly and he really liked it.  He is very hard to please when it comes to Philly sandwiches.  He was a huge fan of the bread.  I really liked the green chili mac and cheese too.  The jalape\\u00f1o mashed potatoes were insanely hot, but if you're into that, they are right up your alley.  I would love to try more of Flancer's sandwiches!"

It was my first time, and I would definitely recommend it to anyone who likes cute restaurants with good food.\\n\\nThe Good:\\n\\n1) It's a great location! I am staying at the Doubletree Hilton Southpark and it was maybe a 5 minute drive. I had considered walking, but the forecast called for rain. I don't know why people complained about parking. Yeah, I had to drive to the fourth level of the parking garage, but it was completely free. Especially given the area, the parking situation was great. \\n\\n2) Decor. It had a cute feel. There was a chalkboard with drinks listed which was cute. I love chalkboards. Also, I sat at the top level over looking the restaurant, so I was able to look at everybody's food and drinks before I ordered.\\n\\n3) Food. The most important part! It was extremely hard to decide what to eat because I wanted everything (in part because I'm visiting from upstate NY where you can't find chicken and waffles, grits, biscuits and gravy, etc). I decided on the red velvet waffle with chicken, a side of fruit, and a half order of biscuits n gravy. I loved the waffle! It had cream cheese frosting on it. Not much, just enough for sweetness. I didn't even add syrup. The chicken was a little dry, but it had great flavor and was very crunchy. The biscuit and gravy was good. It wasn't salty, but was creamy, the biscuit was fluffy, it was just nice. The fruit was ok.\\n\\n4) Service. The hostess was nice. I called before  I came, and the hostess was helpful with all my questions. My waiter was just ok. He didn't seem too happy to be there, but he did take back the one item I didn't like (lemonade) and didn't charge me. I will say, though, he was a lot nicer than many other waiters I've encountered in this area.\\n\\nThe Bad:\\n\\n1) The Lemonade- Since I've been visiting NC this week, I've had much of my favorite fast food, Chick fil A. That being said, the bar is pretty high for lemonade, especially at the price they're charging for it. I expected a fresh squeezed lemonade with real sugar, but I think it was some kind of mix, maybe Minute Maid. It went back.\\n\\n2) Cupcake Latte- They had several flavors, including Peanut Butter Cup latte, but I've never had cupcake flavor so I went for it. It was plain. It just tasted like a really sweet latte. I'll pass.\\n\\n3) Dessert- Yeah, I had dessert too (but I got it to go, don't judge!) I got the pineapple upside down cake, which has a layer of cheesecake in the middle. It came cold, which is fine since I was taking it and could heat it later. It's good, and really sweet. The pineapples on top are amazing. But it was $7 for a small slice. Not that I needed a lot, I just feel like it's overpriced.\\n\\nFor the red velvet waffle with chicken and side of fruit, biscuit and gravy side, pineapple upside down cake, and cupcake latte, I paid $31.

I made a 7:15am appointment and was seen immediately, literally no wait.  He was VERY nice and examined the spot and informed me that it was ringworm.

For 8 freaking months this man told me I had ringworm... ringworm that was not contagious, not itchy, and didn't even resemble ringworm, and NO drugs he gave me had ANY EFFECT WHATS SO EVER.  To me, that would be a red flag that maybe, just maybe I got this diagnosis wrong, but he refused that he could be wrong.

Let's do a biopsy, or call in Dr. whoever to get another opinion\\\"  rather than swear you're right when you know you're wrong.

This PA took ONE look at my \\\"ringworm\\\" and said there's no way that's ringworm!!!  He said it looked like Granuloma Annulare.  He said he would talk to John and come back in.  All of a sudden John thinks it's this now.  But just to be sure, he gives me yet another cream.  I recognized the name of the cream, so I told him, \\\"I think you have given me this before\\\" he said \\\"hmmm, let me look.... No, we haven't given you any creams before\\\"  I was flabbergasted!  I have had a minimum of 5 creams prescribed to me.  I bit my tongue just wanting this appointment to be over.  He said if this cream didn't fix it they would do a biopsy (why he didn't do that 8 freaking MONTHS ago is beyond me!) so I get home and find the exact same cream that did nothing 3 months before when he prescribed it to me the first time!  I was furious!  I just kept telling myself, \\\"just get the biopsy and you will never have to go here again!\\\"  So of course nothing changed except it got bigger (about the size of a half dollar now, very visible as it is growing beyond my armpit and onto my arm and looks like a huge human bite mark) and another one growing next to it.  So he decided to do the punch biopsy. \\n\\n At this appointment as well as all the other appointments they asked what I am allergic to.  I read off the list, among them is polysporin.  The assistant was very nice and when she was done she grabbed a Q-tip with a cream on it.  She got about an inch away and I said \\\"what is that?\\\"  she said \\\"polysporin\\\"  I quickly yell \\\"I'm allergic to that!\\\" before she can get any on me.

I happened upon the place in its heyday, back when you were just as likely to see movie stars and fashion party names grooving to DJ Morningstar (seriously, once I saw Ritchie Rich AND Amanda LePore there in the same night) as you were fantastic queens and their little manservants. The staff was top notch, the mixes were masterpieces and the service in the VIP area was flawless.\\n\\nI wish I could still say the same today. Instead of an overall rating search, look at the trend of the ratings for Krave and you'll see that the customer experience has steadily gone downhill, perhaps stemming from the establishment's recent bankruptcy filing and reduction in quality talent. The drinks are overpriced, the cover charge seems egregious and the cocktail waiters are completely a mixed bag, some are distracted (overworked?) and disengaged while others seem to genuinely be interested in serving. The carpet in the VIP area was so dirty that my high heels would stick like glue in certain areas. \\n\\nWe ordered bottle service, including a bottle of absinthe, but apparently they didn't even know how absinthe should be served and had no sugar cubes on hand. I'm not asking for silver slotted spoons or anything but if you have no clue as to the appropriate mixers, you should take it off the menu, hmmm? And at $350 a bottle, if you're out of Grey Goose, you send one of the little bois to the 7-11 up the street to make your clients happy, right? Ok, and also, my diamond shoes were too tight, but let's talk about what really matters: the club itself. The dancers are stuffing their jocks with what seems to be Chunky soup cans, to the point that it's laughable, and the DJ? Oh my god. So not good. Even the staff was commenting that he sucked. What's more, despite the fact that we were dropping close to a thousand dollars in bottle service, the owner of the club decided to block our view of the dance floor and then treated us so disrespectfully when we asked him to move that I couldn't believe he was actually the owner. Seriously, if you treat your supposed VIP customers like this, I'm not surprised that you're facing bankruptcy, Kelly Murphy.\\n\\nAnd what used to be a crowd rife with a half dozen drag queens, there hasn't been a single queen to be seen the last two visits. Perhaps they are the club's canary in a coal mine and Krave is simply no longer fabulous enough to entertain them. The real tell here is that despite the fact that we were last there on the night that Krave was serving as the Logo afterparty for the Lady Gaga concert, at what should have been the prime thick of the party scene, the dance floor was starting to thin out considerably. It seems that most people were there just to see if the Lady herself would show up and when it became clear that she wasn't, they headed for greener pastures.  I'm following their lead and heading to Piranha next time."

Everyone I talked to was great, no problems with the changes, and the hostess set our table a bit apart from the Saturday night holiday madness. While I wouldn't say that the food tends to arrive quickly, I've always had good service (even with the group of 12), nice recommendations, and good advice on ingredients or substitutions when I've asked. I don't eat red meat, so that's always appreciated.\\n\\nWhile it gets loud at busy times (and it does get busy), I like the industrial/bistro atmosphere, and especially the view over the lake. Ask for a table near the lake windows (or, when it's warm, the outside tables!) for a bit more intimacy. There's a wide selection of beers and wines, including reasonably priced and quite good house wines, and some lovely specialty cocktails.\\n\\nFor appetizers, I've recently ordered the picollo fritto and the cheese plate. Recent unexpected favorites among the picollo fritto items have been fennel and lemon. The cheese plate had a nice variety of cheeses, many of them local -- cheddar, blue, chevre, etc -- as well as fruit and a unexpectedly delish vegan \\\"salami\\\" made out of figs and nuts. I had salad and fish for dinner on both of my recent visits (the salmon once and the mahi mahi once), and both were fresh, grilled nicely, and clearly served quickly. Well marinated, hot, moist, and flaky. The lentils that came with the salmon were a bit on the salty side, but the bok choy & fennel with the mahi were a lovely sweet-and-sour complement. Yum. My husband is a fan of their cassoulet and their steak (although, warning, the steak does come with both frites and butter). Overall, their fish seems reliably great, but I haven't been thrilled with their pastas when I've tried them in the past. The orechiette sauce, for instance, is oily and a bit too heavy on the garlic and olives, which overwhelms the broccoli rabe and tomatoes. Sad, because I adore a good broccoli rabe. As far as desserts, I've tried a bunch of different items, all good. The chocolate cake and the sorbets (rotating, often in unusual flavors like olive oil or buttermilk) are favorites.\\n\\nSo: while I wouldn't say that everything is fabulous at Sardine (hence the 4 stars), there are a lot of very good options. It's a nice place with a good vibe, accommodating of large or small groups, and definitely on my Madison favorites list. It's worth the trip (or a few!)."

I apologize for the great detail, but I want you to understand what a horrific experience we had.\\n\\nOur reservation was for one night to celebrate my sister's 21st birthday.

I had to ask why before they would offer me a baggage attendant that would help me. When the baggage attendant approached, I was really hoping he would turn things around. I was sadly disappointed. I loaded our bags onto the caddy, and he was writing, and had never said anything to me or my group, so I assumed we were finished. I proceeded to head inside. He came after me about 3 minutes later, and held his hands out and asked, \\\"How am I going to get these to you if you don't wait a minute?\\\" I followed him back out to the valet area. He then accosted me for placing an item on the luggage caddy that wasn't \\\"in a proper bag\\\" (it was a box of crackers...) and he rolled his eyes and grabbed a plastic bag and placed the crackers in the bag. He then asked me to count my bags. I did, and I reported the number. He began to explain that the bags could take up to an hour to get to our room, and that me taking them myself was still not an option. In that case, I decided I would need my diaper bag. I removed it from the caddy, and he rolled his eyes again and proceeded to dramatically rip up the ticket and said \\\"We need to count again.\\\" He then proceeded to tell me that when I got to the room, I would need to call them to bring the bags up. I asked him to just send them now, since we were on our way out, and he said \\\"We don't do that. You have to be there to accept them.\\\" When I finally was released by the baggage king, we headed to our rooms to \\\"accept\\\" our bags that they wouldn't allow us to take by ourselves. I waited on hold for 4 minutes before anyone answered and they demanded a code that was on my paper. I had a baby in my arms, so I asked them to look it up by our room number or reservation since our last name had been taken, but they said they required the code. I told them to wait a second so I could dig it out, and they told me I would have to call back when I was ready...\\n\\nThe rest of the experience continued in that direction. We made a point to avoid all restaurants, bars and gambling in the Golden Nugget since the experience had been so consistent. There is clearly some type of management issue that the staff is not happy with, and as a customer, I felt it.

This is far too rare at most restaurants.\\n\\nI have eaten many different things there, all excellent, and I've seen others order many other things there both vegetarian and non-vegetarian, and I have NEVER seen a diner unhappy with their meal.  Never.  My absolute favorite is the hot and sour soup.  It is the best I've had in my entire life, and I'm a hot and sour soup long-time fan.

I would have got some prime rib, but I just don't like that cut of meat. The fattier the better, I say! This plate was just the first of a lot of different paleo-ish foods I picked.

I waited, (Checked in via YELP) and Finally was greated. I said, YAY ME, I WAS JUST ABOUT TO WALK OUT, ME AND CASPER, the friendly ghost. (since i must be invisible). She gave me a menu, and did her best David Blain (poof, ghost)..The bartender NEVER showed up.. STEEEERIKE TWO\\n\\nWell, by this time, maybe 4-6 mins later (a total of 6-8 mins being ignored..,,while on lunch) I just walked off, and took my talents to Fox & Hound. With that being said, thanks Nix for saving me 8-12 bucks!\\nSTEEEERIKE THREE.... your OUTTA HERE!!"

Don't know why really, it just looks...off...like I can see people waiting in line and I get this irrational idea that people are just standing there...breathing on everything. I don't know! Also the reason for a two star verses three star review is that they don't take debit or credit cards but instead have a lovely little ATM that is expensive. It's 2013, almost 2014 actually, stop taking a stand or making whatever statement you're trying to make and just get a card machine."

The moment he showed his ID they asked him for his zodiac sign. WTF. not everyone knows or follow that stuff. So then the bouncer calls his \\\"manager\\\" and asks him to look at the ID. The bouncer told him that he'd seen the same ID pass through earlier already. Again, WTF!! are you kidding me?

So I spoke to the \\\"manager\\\" and he let me and my bff get in line. Thinking it was for the VIP guest list, I decided to give them the benefit of the doubt.

The Vegetable rolls were good and I can taste the freshness of the vegetables. Chicken Satay, the chicken was tender and juicy.

We got in kind of late and checked in around 9:30 pm. Check-in was fine. We let the clerk know we needed a ride to the airport in the morning and it turns out that you can leave your car there if you're planning to stay on your return trip and the stay is 14 days or less (I asked after a friend informed me you can do this--beats paying for airport parking!). We were flying to Hawaii and would be gone for 10 days, so this was a good deal.\\n\\nOur room was on the ground floor and was not nicer than a Motel 6 as far as I remember Motel 6s being from when I was a kid. It was hot and humid in the hotel so I turned on the AC. That clanky piece of crap managed to wake me up every single time it went on during the night. A HORRIBLE night of sleep.\\n\\nTo make matters worse, there were a bunch of college-aged drunk kids staying in the hotel who showed up around 10:30 pm. They hung out right outside of my door and were up and down the stairs laughing and being obnoxious until 1 am. I typically am not shy about sticking my head out the door and telling people to be quiet, but since I was alone with my kids, I didn't think it was the best idea. I called the front desk around 11 pm and they said their driver (who doubles as security) would drive back there when he returned from the airport, in about 20 minutes. It was not 20 minutes, that's for sure. Considering we had to be up at 5 am, waiting ANY amount of time was infuriating. They should have had someone on the premises who can act in the capacity of a security guard or something. I heard the van drive by around 1 am and that's when the inconsiderate a-holes finally went up to their rooms.\\n\\nIn the morning (at 5 am) I couldn't help myself and as we were heading to the front desk to catch the shuttle, I knocked loudly on one of the doors of the worst offenders and called them jerks. Passive aggressive, I know, but whatever. In the lobby, while waiting for the shuttle, I heard other guests complaining about the loud jerks, too.\\n\\nThe shuttle ride was fine; the driver was a nice guy. There was no way in hell, though, I'd be staying there on our way back. I was worried about my car the entire time we were gone and I didn't cancel my reservation until the day we were supposed to leave HI and stay there again. We got into PHX around 10:30 at night and we waited for the shuttle with about 5 other guests who were staying there. Shuttle after shuttle came for other hotels and ours didn't show up until 11:20 pm. I didn't want to draw too much attention to us since we weren't planning to stay so I didn't complain much. When we got to the hotel, I tipped the guy well and we booked it to the back of the hotel to my car. Thankfully, my car was fine and we made the 10-15 minute drive to a much nicer place--the Hilton Garden Inn. That place cost about $80 more and the AC was still not very quiet, but the hotel was quiet and I turned off the AC and surprisingly wasn't hot. Anyway, that's another review.\\n\\nI will NEVER stay here again. Ever."

        "sentence": "It saddens me that I have to write this review because I had such high hopes for Always Unleashed. Their method for allowing the dogs to interact with each other and their pre-screening process for evaluating new dogs led me to believe that they truly cared about the quality of the stay that dogs had there; unfortunately I have found that is not the case. They do not dedicate the necessary staffing resources or have the proper controls in place in ensure that dogs have a healthy and happy stay at their establishment. Obvious signs of sickness go overlooked without apology and their is a seeming disregard for the trust that owners place with them to keep their dogs healthy. When I picked my dog up from Always Unleashed after a weekend stay I was immediately shocked at how malnourished he appeared and how lethargic he was acting, they simply stated that dogs play hard when they are there and that his behaviour was normal. When we got home it became even more obvious that my dog was very sick and probably had been for the duration of his stay there. He was vomiting and had horrible diarrhea, he wouldn't drink any water and when I weighed him I was shocked for find that in a matter of 3 days he had lost 10 pounds. Immediately (after measuring his weight loss), I took my dog to the veterinarian, on the way I called to ask if they had noticed anything out of the ordinary with his behaviour - I was told that he was very active the entire time, that he has eaten all of his meals, and that he didn't have any vomiting or diarrhea. When I pressed to find out specifics about his meals (which I was suspicious of because nearly half of the food that I sent with him was returned to me) I was again told that he had eaten his meals, when I explained that was impossible because he still had almost half of his food leftover and it was measured out exactly I was given excuses like \\\"sometimes it is hard to watch all of the dogs\\\" and \\\"sometimes we miss lunches because we are only used to feeding twice a day\\\" even though previously I had been assured that he had eaten every meal completely and that it had been specifically documented as such. When I asked again to have the owner check specifically with people that had interacted with Biscuit if he had signs of sickness like diarrhea and vomitting and when that may have begun I was told \\\"well, it is really hard to tell because sometimes a dog may vomit and another dog will just eat it, so we won't notice\\\" and that there are too many dogs to be observant of each dogs bowel movements, and \\\"I told them to watch for that type of thing, but it was about six months ago so I don't know if they are still implementing it\\\". At every question that I posed the owner was defensive without taking any responsibility, always looking for some way to demonstrate that it was not her or her establishments fault, I was never offered so much as an insincere apology. After tests the vet informed me that my dog was severely dehydrated, and that he had a foreign body in his intestinal tract, after confirming with an ultrasound that he had a bowel obstruction they took him to surgery to remove it. I am grateful to say that he is home with us now recovering. I do not blame Always Unleashed for whatever it was that my dog ate to obstruct his bowel (even though with appropriate supervision that could have been potentially avoided as well), but I do believe that my dogs symptoms should have been noticed much earlier so that he could have been treated sooner and gone through much less suffering. Also, I was blatantly lied to with regards to him getting the food we prescribed, and the story regarding his behaviour there changed from entirely positive that he was healthy the whole time to unsure at all of how he acted or even ate. If you are lucky enough that your dog doesn't run into any trouble while you are gone, then he probably would have a great time at always unleashed, but if you are unfortunate enough that your dog needs some extra help or care, they do not have the resources, know-how, or respect for the love of your dog, to take the necessary steps to take care of him properly. Any dog owner concerned with the health of their dog while they are away, should avoid this place at all costs."

Upon arriving in our room, we quickly noticed a strong odor of cigarette smoke in the room. We had specifically requested a non-smoking room when booking and confirmed this with the front desk while we were checking in. The bathroom also scored failing points as the toilet seat wouldn't stay up. This might sound like a minor thing, but it's not. As a man, I had to hold the seat up with one hand so it wouldn't fall down on me as I was going #1. Additionally, the walls of our room were paper thin, so we could hear our neighbor's conversation word for word (they also were disappointed with the room).\\n\\nShortly after checking in, we headed up to their Top of the World rotating restaurant where we had made reservations and were meeting another couple. From the moment we sat down, we felt that the server (Rebecca H. according to my receipt) was in a rush to get us out the door. We came for fine dining and I wasn't even asked if I wanted a drink before dinner. Truly astonishing! When it came time to receive the check, we asked Rebecca if she would split it by couple. She didn't even try to hide how frustrated this made her. She was able to split it, but not after making a production about how she had to go \\\"look into whether or not this could be done.\\\" Give me a break. Our table had spent nearly $400 in total on this dinner. A real restaurant would have asked us if we wanted the check split before printing it out.\\n\\nAs for the food, my wife and I both ordered the filet. I thought it was average and she thought it was slightly below average. My advice: check out the observation deck (free for hotel guests) but skip dinner here. It's nothing special.\\n\\nAfter dinner, we headed over to the Bellagio to gamble and drink for the remainder of the evening and early morning. We returned to the Stratosphere at approximately 4am. From the front door, we had to walk the length of the casino to get to the north elevators. We had dressed up for the night. I was in a suit and my wife was wearing a classy, shorter cut dress. As we passed through the poker room, there was only one game going on which wasn't surprising given the hour. As we passed this table, I immediately began hearing heckling aimed at my wife coming from the approximately seven men playing at this table. The phrase that sticks out in mind is \\\"she's gonna take it tonight.\\\" Of course, it's also hard to forget the sexual grunting and moaning sounds that we were also treated to. As I looked back at the table, they began to actually mock me with chants of \\\"oh look, he's getting mad now!\\\" What upsets me more than these comments themselves was that neither the dealer or the poker floor manager who was standing nearby said a word to the players. I doubt that this heckling technically broke any hotel or casino rules, but they certainly broke the rules of common decency. I own a business and if I learned that two of my employees sat idly and let this go on without saying a word, I would have been furious and the employees would have been reprimanded and/or fired on the spot. It was so disrespectful to us as customers and to my wife as a woman that neither employee had the guts to say \\\"calm down guys\\\" or \\\"those type of comments aren't appreciated here\\\".\\n\\nWhen we got back to the room, I called the front desk and they transferred me over to the poker floor manager who we had previously walked by. After telling him what we had happened, he told me there were two poker games going on and that I would have to give him a description of the dealer so he could determine which was the problem table. This was an outright lie. There was only one game going on. I decided that was enough on the phone and walked down to the front desk. Here I was, a paying hotel guest who had also spent over $200 at dinner in the hotel earlier in the night, standing at the front desk at 4:30am. I spent about 20 minutes talking with the night manager who \\\"would be just as upset\\\" if he was in my position but \\\"men will be men especially in Vegas\\\". In the end, I wound up with free breakfast and a late checkout.\\n\\nFor what it's worth, the breakfast sucked. My stomach didn't feel right for the entire rest of our trip.

So comfortable. Like Heaven. \\nConceirge- Awesome people. I had them put balloons, a Happy Birthday banner and a flower in the room before we got there, and it was such a great surprise. They did it just right!\\nAirport Checkin- WONDERFUL. This is the only hotel who has this at the Vegas airport. I checked in here so the conceirge could have a heads up that we were coming and have time to set everything up. The lovely man who helped me in the airport check in was so accomadating. At first I was hesitant to check in here because I thought I couldnt get the room I wanted, or you know...haggle like most people do at check in to get the perfect room they want. \\nTHIS WAS EASIER. I got my Non-Smoking room, close to the elevator (actually the first one in the hall. If you have seen the LONG hallways at the MGM you know what Im talking about), high floor but a possible view. \\nHE GAVE ME all that I wanted. This was a room that was \\\"blocked\\\" in his system, but had the manager unblock it so he can give it to me. AWESOME. Will always check in for MGM this way. \\nRIDE TO HOTEL- MGM is the first hotel when you exit the airport. Fare is like $15 (up to 5 ppl in a taxi). DOnt take the MGM shuttle which charges $15 per person, roundtrip. Taxi is cheaper. \\nWe won some money, swam a lot, and relaxed. So much fun."

I don't know why he couldn't just ask someone else to get them for me, it isn't often a customer comes and hunts you down, it usually means they are desperate for service!\\n- He brought the silverware, and ran off, while our drinks were completely empty.  Had to wave him down again to get water refills.\\n- The final straw was at then end.  He asked if we wanted anything else, and three times, I said the check please (anyone could tell at that point I was frustrated and ready to just leave).  He brought the check over (by then, my dad and son had left the restaurant, my husband was packing up my other son).  He then left for a LONG time.

Most spices are offered in prefilled allotments and in bulk (though things like the aforementioned ghost chili powder are only sold in prepacked since they are dangerous to open around customers). The prices are really good - everyday spices are cheap and exotic stuff you've never even heard of is usually a bit more, but still way below the spice pricing scale and the supermarket.\\n\\nLast time I was in they were running a Spice 101 class which looked interesting.

What makes me angry is how rude security was to us when we reported it. Honestly, I was not expecting to see that money again. But the guy was such a dick to us about taking a chance on reporting it.

The bed was one of the most comfortable I've experienced.  The gym was ok... we liked the one we went to at the Palazzo next door on one day so I think we were comparing it a lot.  I did like that the gym was in the spa area and the bathroom facilities were unreal.  I think one of the biggest reasons I can't give this place a 5 is simply the location.

This salad was just as bland, and what I found particularly insulting in that there are little orange pieces of carrot in here that, if you weren't paying close attention, look a whole hell of a lot like the shrimp they put in this flavorless concoction. I thought Italian food was supposed to be flavorful. I've had pasta salads from supermarkets, italian markets on Taylor St. in Chicago, and made my own. I can honestly say that their pasta salads are easily the worst I've had."

If Im feeling a bit more ambitious, I'll sometimes venture over to sandwiches of which I really enjoy the eggplant parmigiana.  Its huge and topped with tasty marinara.  The fries are nothing amazing but always come hot and crisp, which for most restaurants is a challenge.  I also really enjoy their various pasta dishes.  The kitchen staff understands the concept of al dente and the portions are generous.  My only complaint is their pasta trends a little on the pricey side whereas I find the other sections of the menu (sandwiches, salads, pizzas) very reasonable.  \\n\\nThe bartenders and servers are always accommodating and as an added bonus the video poker machines at the bar seem to payout better than some other local places.

I constantly receive compliments on my nails.  She always remembers my name whenever I come in, which really makes you feel welcome.  She goes the extra mile and really takes her time.  I don't mind spending an afternoon at the nail spa, because I make time for it.  I think if you are in a hurry, you should let your manicurist know so they can try and work in your time constraints.\\nI also enjoy getting my eyelashes done there.  They do eyelash extensions for a very reasonable price.  They last 2-3 weeks and look very nice.  I usually get them done for special occasions.  If they start to come out before the 2 week period, they will fix them for you.  I would ask for Van or Mimi to do your eyelashes.  They both do a great job.\\nAlso, a bit of advice for people that don't like to wait to get service... make an appointment.  Yes, this place is busy.  Evenings and weekends are the craziest.  They are very popular, evidence of how great they are.  I've gone on a Friday evening and it's packed.  Even with an appointment, I had to wait 20 minutes.  I didn't mind though, because I would never go anywhere else.  They had to turn away people that just walked in.  Walk-Ins are welcome, but it's not guaranteed you'll get service.  Monday through Wednesday is usually a pretty good time to go.\\nAnyway, if you are looking for a \\\"Grade A\\\" place to get your nail and waxing services done, I really think you should give Mirage Nail & Spa a try.  :O)"
