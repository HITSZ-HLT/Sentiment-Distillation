I'm not sure if that's much of a steal after reading that people were getting in for free, but still worth it. Because we had general admission tickets, we sat on the side but still had a good view of the show due to the small size of the venue. One man that stood in front of me in line for 40 minutes and one who was sitting in my row were of the final 11 who stayed on stage. This makes the show seem pretty real and not plants or actors.\\n\\nI do believe that some who are not in an extremely deep trance try to exaggerate to stay on stage but that's fine if they want to make a fool of themselves consciously. Overall, the show is really funny, Marc Savard is HOT (that photo does no justice), and for the same price as a movie, is far better entertainment.

I was then taken back, the doctor listened to everything i had to say and then diagnosed. He gave me a few prescriptions including antibiotics for my throat and pain meds for my back pain. The doctor was very friendly and attentive. I walked out VERY happy. I was treated so well and probably if need would go back.  I thought that was the last time I would hear from them in awhile. After 2 days my doctor called to see how i was doing and i told him okay. The next morning i woke up with lets say a scorching sore throat that turned into strepp throat. Called urgent care and another provider talked to me over the phone and called in some last minute prescriptions because i couldn't swallow. I cant even begin to tell you how great this place is.  I had strepp throat and an infection and was so happy they could help. I wouldn't go anywhere else.

Thanks to a Yelp event and Petite Maison's generosity, I was fortunate to win a 10 course meal with wine pairings for four people. I have to say, my hopes were very high and I went into the evening expecting to write a five star review. By the end of the night I was left wishing I could give a 10 star rating. Let's see if this review can do any justice to our night. Our reservation was for 7pm and I was accompanied by my fiancee and another couple.\\n\\nFirst off, our waiter/sommelier was Dustin. He was an outstanding server and a friendly young man. Dustin was unbelievably informative on each and every dish and wine served. I highly recommend requesting him when you make a reservation. Dustin gave the background and history of each wine along with how you should drink the wine with the food.\\n\\nWe started the night with a Bordeaux Sauvignon Blanc to accompany our first two dishes: bread puffs and a chilled Sweet Corn Soup with Truffle Oil. The bread puffs were freshly baked and delicious, but the soup was especially phenomenal! A great way to start the night.\\n\\nNext we had a Chardonnay to go along with a Beet, Radish and Multicolored Cauliflower Salad and then a caviar dish. The salad was light and delicious. The caviar was on top of a creamy scrambled egg with truffle I believe. By itself, the caviar was a bit too fishy for me, but when combined with the egg it was very good.   I appreciated this dish even though it wasn't my favorite since it was my first time trying caviar.\\n\\nA Pinot Noir was the third wine and the first red of the evening. This wine was paired first with pan seared loup de mer, which literally means \\\"wolf of the sea\\\" in French. The fish was incredible! Definitely one of the highlights of the night! You may know it by its Italian name, branzino. We were then served an excellent soft shelled crab dish. It was fried to perfection and served atop a delectable sauce.\\n\\nThe fourth wine of the night blew us all away! We were served a wine by Domaine Faillenc Sainte Marie winery. It was made with a Cinsault grape (pronounced \\\"sinso\\\", or close to that) and it provided the most unique scents and tastes that any of us at the table had experienced. I'll never forget this wine and I am determined to find it somewhere. Thank you Dustin for exposing me to its greatness! My fellow Yelpers, you have to check it out. The Cinsault was paired with duck and lamb dishes. Both meats were out of this world and prepared perfectly, just like every other dish we experienced.\\n\\nLastly, the two dessert dishes were accompanied by a port. Not a big port guy, but I guess it's the wine to have when eating dessert. For a port I actually enjoyed this one. The first desert was a slice of baguette served with cheese and fruit. The second were mini chocolate doughnuts with a heavenly cream dipping sauce. Perfect ending to a perfect meal.\\n\\nEach dish was spaced out perfectly from each other. I was shocked to discover that the Petite Maison culinary masterpiece took four hours. The time absolutely flew by. I ate every single bite and drank every single drop. Thank you Chef James Porter, Dustin, and Yelp for what was the most incredible and memorable dining experience of my life. Seriously, wow! Great food, great company, great memories.

We told Melinda that we did not want a ceremony, and that we just wanted to have the license signed to say that we were married. We told her we did not believe in that kind of thing. Immediately she started talking to us about god (neither of us are religious) She could have asked us if we had a religious preference, but no. She continued on her preaching by telling us that if we didn't have god in our marriage it would fail, and that it was no longer about my husbands happiness but only about mine. I DO NOT agree with that statement at all. Marriage is about both parties being happy, not just the wife's. Finally she stopped talking about god, but then wanted us to recite vows, which my husband is strictly against. He went back and forth with her for a bit, and she told us \\\"if I would have known this was going to be a marriage of convenience, I wouldn't have done it\\\" She then proceeded to ask us if we were in the Military, I suppose to insinuate that we were there for a contract marriage. Now my husband and I both served in the Military and we are both out now, so this is for sure not a contract marriage! She then tried to tell us that it was illegal for her to sign the marriage license if we did not say vows, which is complete BS! She then said she would sign it but we would have to pay a minimum of $50 as a minister gratuity. Overall she got $100 out of us just to sign a piece of paper and give myself and my husband a headache. Our wedding will surely be memorable, but for all the wrong reasons.

Seriously, what muscles do these girls have that I don't?! Sugar honey iced tea.\\n\\nSo I'm going to give you a disclaimer for the meal that I wish had been there for me to see when I had dined there this Saturday: do NOT have a 6 course meal if you plan on going clubbing later that evening. Just don't do it. Why? Well, after 6 delicious courses you will have no other desire but to curl up into a ball and slip into the inevitable food coma. Nothing else. No really, nothing else. \\n\\nThat being said, the fare at Marrakech was heavenly. Here's a detailed course by course recap of our FEAST:\\n\\n1st Course - Moroccan Style Shrimp Scampi (sauteed in lemon, wine and garlic): I could not get enough of this dish. We were given two plates of shrimp for the four of us and it was such a great serving. I could not get enough of the sauce and kept dipping my bread in it to munch on. I knew I  was a goner once half of my loaf was already in my belly at after this course.\\n\\n2nd Course - Harira Soup (lentil, rice, lemon and spices): I usually dislike lentils but I really enjoyed their version of this dish. The flavor of the lentils did not overpower the other flavors and I really appreciated the tomato-lemon essence. True it was probably 90 something degrees outside but I really did enjoy that hot cup of soup!\\n\\n3rd Course - Moroccan Sampler (hummus, zaaluk, Moroccan style olives, beets & carrots): Wow that was definitely homemade hummus. Wonderfully fresh with a hint of smokiness. We were given even MORE bread at this point (i.e. warm pita) to mop this up with. The zaaluk (eggplant tomato dip) was to die for as well.\\n\\n4th Course - Beef Brochette (marinated beef kabobs): Beef skewers served on a whole pineapple. Unfortunately I dropped two pieces of my kabob like a child but I really enjoyed my meat. It was a tad chewy but great seasoning.\\n\\n**Please note that by this course you should make sure that you have car arrangements figured out once you receive this entree otherwise you might be screwed FYI.**\\n\\n5th Course - Royal Moroccan Couscous Platter with Chicken (served the traditional way with heaps of vegetables including squash and cabbage): At this point we were totally dying. I think I had 4 bites of this dish and had to call it quits from fear of exploding. The chicken was tender and literally fell off the bone and the couscous were fluffy perfection. Our poor waiter thought we didn't like the food but we reassured him that we did. \\n\\n6th Course - B'Stilla (classic pastry filled with bananas, walnuts and chocolate covered with powdered sugar served with Moroccan mint tea): Basically this was a warm, flaky puff pastry filled with all of the above. \\n\\nThe voluptuous belly dancers entertained us about every half hour during our meal which was a great distraction from our constant noshing.\\n\\n\\nOverall Marakech was a fantastic and AFFORDABLE dining experience in Las Vegas. Now I will reiterate that the food was great.. but the reason why this restaurant received 5 stars instead of 4 was because the amazing owner drove me and the rest of our party to the Palms after waiting outside his restaurant for an hour for a cab.

        "sentence": "Hard to believe the home of the Diamondbacks has now eclipsed 15 years in existence.  In modern ballpark terms thats almost ancient.  Its still a great place to catch a ballgame and getting a seat for any game isn't hard.  Particularly during a hot brutal summer when most of the sports world is quiet, a Diamondbacks game at Chase is a great escape as they close the retractable roof and blast the air conditioning to make it feel like spring inside.  And it remains the very first domed sporting venue in the world to use real grass.  Not everything about this place is perfect, but there are certainly more positives than negatives.  A quick rundown of the good and the bad:\\n\\nThe Good:\\n-A retractable roof that allows for outdoor baseball during good weather and a close roof during bad weather.  Vitally important during the summer when the mercury soars.  That said a number of night games during the summer will have the roof open as the air conditioning will keep it comfortable inside even if its in the upper 80s/low 90s outside\\n-Good views from pretty much every seat.  Each upper deck seat, outfield seat, and even restaurant seat has a near perfect view of the field so there really isn't a bad seat in the house\\n-Plenty of concession stands on every level selling the ballpark basics (hot dogs, beer, nachos, pretzels, soda, etc.).  Sometimes the lines can get long if one or more of the concession booths sell a specialty item (Cold Stone Ice Cream, Smashburger, mexican food, etc).  But overall there's a good variety to choose from throughout the ballpark\\n-There are actually some relatively affordable single game ticket options.  In fact most of the upper deck and lower outfield seats are $25/person or less.  Compared with other ballparks, thats pretty cheap for those same seats.\\n\\nThe Bad:\\n-Concession prices are (not surprisingly) outrageous.  One time a date of mine got a small salad.  Price?  $12.  Another friend of mine got a cup of local microbrew beer.  Price?  $11.  Still another of my friends got a regular Hamburger and fries from the Smashburger stand.  Price?  $11.  TGI Fridays has a restaurant in the left outfield area with standards TGI Friday's fare.  The price?  About 3 times what you'd pay at a normal Friday's.  Catch my drift?  Food prices are ludicrous.\\n-As easy as it is to get seats, it can oftentimes feel pretty empty in there.  The TV watching experience has made it to where local baseball fans don't goto as many games as in the past, meaning Chase rarely ever sells out anymore.  Next time Chase gets an overall, they need to reduce capacity to make it feel less abandoned in there.  My suggestion?  Widen the seats and reduce the number of seats from 49,000 to 35,000.  That's in line with alot of the newer parks out there today.\\n-The bathrooms could use some updates and be better maintained.  I can't speak for the women's restrooms, but three things about the men's rooms stand out.  No privacy walls for the urinals, not nearly enough faucets, and no air dry mechanisms.  Plus it seems the staff never maintains them to where its a disaster in there by the 6th inning\\n\\nOverall the D'Backs organization does a pretty good job keeping Chase in good working condition.  Its a family friendly venue with lots of areas to explore.  They do a good job updating food and entertainment options each season to stay on the cutting edge.  And its centrally located downtown and easily accessible via the light rail.  I usually goto 3 or 4 games a year here and plan to continue doing so for the foreseeable future.

A lot of them have lower quality fish but not twister, that combined with the fact that the sushi chefs are friendly and generous and their 13 meals and get one free promotion, they had me sold. I've eaten here for free many, many, times. Recently though, even I have to admit their standards are falling. Now they have added new items to the menu, superwhite comes to mind, (it was good) and the ninja and angry ninja are still superb, but we ordered the spiderman, and it was not right. Came out as a completely different roll than ever before.. weird, pretty good, but still weird. So we ordered another one to see if maybe they changed the recipe, this one was different than any roll we'd ever had before.. still pretty good but what the hell were they serving us. Not being nit-picky but its pretty bad if the customers know the rolls better than the staff.. One of my favorite things to eat there is the monkey ball, I usually order 3 or 4 to myself but the sauce on these tasted so burnt and not sweet at all that it made them horrible, we barely finished one between us. The service wasn't great this time either as there were more staff in the restaurant than customers and we still couldn't get served/our order taken in a timely fashion. This coupled with the fact that when the guy combined my stamps from different cards he took all 8 off of cards with very long expirations and put them all on a card that had one stamp with a very close expiration. When I returned a week and a half later to claim it they told me I was a week late and most of the cards that I had their expiration was over 6 months away. Looks like they are trying to cut some corners and save some money but I think all that it is doing is driving long term customers away. I mean their fryer wasn't even to temp and all the fried things took forever and came out almost white instead of Golden Brown like they should be. For many years I would have given this place a 5 stars rating but no longer unless they clean up their act they may be another Vegas sushi casualty, especially when there are many better places now that are closer than the 45 mins it takes to drive to twister.

Indian food has to be on the top of my list for favorite cuisines, and I am sad to say there aren't many or any great Indian restaurants that I have found in Phoenix. Flavors of India, however, seems to satisfy my palate. I enjoy the chicken tikka masala every time. I have also tried the curry chicken, which is also very tasty. The chicken is very fresh and tender, both the light and dark meat. The naan is a bit flat and not soft or chewy enough for my taste, but it does its job. I really enjoy their basmati rice. It's not the most elaborate or flavorful I've ever had, but for some reason, I'm drawn to it, and even crave it. There's no saffron or cloves; it's a bit on the simple side, and just a tad bit sticky. The samosas are decent, although I have had better. If you are in the mood for some Indian food, and this place is close by, I suggest you head on over. Prices are reasonable. Two can eat for 30 bucks, including multiple appetizers. The food is prepared quickly. It's not the prettiest of restaurants but it has it's interesting Indian decor with a twist of Mexican thrown in. At least that's my impression.

Instead of changing in a ladies' locker room, I had to take my bag into the solo bathroom in the gym to change into my suit. My friend and I both booked massages for the day but they had to be an hour apart. Now I know why. It's because they only have one massage therapist. I didn't see any other treatments going on during my visit either. \\n\\nNow, my experience is no fault of the massage therapist's. She was professional, nice and provided a nice massage. The massage therapist mentioned that I was not very relaxed during my massage and I wanted to comment back that it's very hard to relax when you're getting a massage in a random room off the hotel gym with the hotel hallway on the other side of the wall. The icing on the cake was when a group of people (maybe on a tour?) walked in on my massage. Yes, they walked into my massage room right smack in the middle of my massage. It was one of the most awkward moments of my life. Again, the massage therapist was wonderful and I feel bad that she has to be associated with this disappointing spa experience. \\n\\nDon't be fooled by the long menu listing a variety of treatments. All will be done in a maximum of three small rooms off the gym. There is no sense of spa here and if I could have canceled my massage upon arrival, I would have. This shouldn't be considered a \\\"day spa.\\\" If they are going to promote anything, they should say that offer \\\"spa services\\\" within the hotel, but there was nothing that fell within the \\\"day spa\\\" category during my experience. It doesn't take a lot to please me, but when I'm spending a decent amount of money on a spa day, I expect a spa day. \\n\\nIf you visit this hotel, stay the night and enjoy the pool and renowned golf course, but think twice before booking a spa day here.",

She approached our table without an apology or anything to say for us having waited for 10/15 minutes to be greeted after we sat.

At this point, we had asked to speak to the manager and he said \\\"it's probably just a small bug or something that was in the basket before they plated the nachos. It's harmless\\\". Ummmm...I'm not eating anything if a bug (at least a half inch and ugly) comes crawling out of the food. The manager said that all he could do was remove the nachos from the bill. That's not ok! Neither of us had much of an appetite and would not be touching our food. He stated that he would call the higher-up and see if it would be ok to take care of our tab. Sure enough, the answer was only the nachos will be removed from the total. I was shocked. I got the owner or GM's card and called while getting no where.

Now I am leaving my honest review of actual events that occurred during our last visit.   I am leaving names out of this review.\\n\\nFirst of all, our family used to absolutely love this place.  Usually LBS Burger is a place where my family went and we always had good service and food.  However, last time we visited was far from what we expected.\\n\\nWe arrived at LBS Burger at 8:35pm to celebrate a special occasion.  We were promptly seated at approximately 8:40pm in the back of the restaurant.  It was a party of 5, with two adults and three children.  Our first encounter with our server - bald young adult with black earlobe rings (who was later identified by the General Manager) was less than pleasant off the bat.  He greeted us with a non-energetic and non-professional and \\\"What's up?\\\" for our drink orders.  We brushed it off.\\n\\nWe ordered a water, a diet coke and three root beers for our children.  A few minutes later, our food order was taken.  We proceeded to receive our drinks and eat our appetizers: potato twisters and fried cheese curds.  We had requested extra sauce for the potato twisters but did not receive it.\\n\\nWe quickly ran out of drinks and sauce and we tried to get the attention of our server for over 20 minutes.  We pleaded for help from a red haired server who seemed less than interested and then we finally went caught the person from the front desk that seats people when he was seating a new table.\\n\\nOur server continued to ignore us and the desk person which was standing by our table trying to flag him down.  It was blatantly obvious that it was done on purpose.  When we finally got our server back, we again ask for drinks and refills.\\n\\nHis response \\\"Alriiight, alriiight, alriiiight\\\" - like we were old friends, but we are not.  He takes the two cups from my children and my wife hands helpfully hands him the third cup. He proceeds to rudely snatch it from her and walk away. Which completely caught  us off guard.  At this point it had been over 30 minutes since we initially needed drinks.\\n\\nI had had enough from this point.  I found the manager to complain and ask for a new server.  While this was happening our server found his way from the back of the restaurant (where the kitchen and our table was) to the front where I was and stared me down and shoved into my shoulder with his shoulder as he walked pass.  Right in front of the manager!\\n\\nThe manager sent the server to the back and apologized to me as the server went to the back of the restaurant while I was still at the front.    While the server was walking to the back again he said to my wife and children \\\"F**k you!\\\"\\n\\nMy wife decided it was time for us to leave and we did promptly.  Again, the manager was apologetic and gave me his card and told me he was going to take care of the server with HR as soon as he could.  The time on my watch now was 9:30pm - it kind of wasted our night out.\\n\\nThe worst part was running back to our vehicle from the restaurant - not knowing where the server was.  We were actually fearing for our lives at this point until we could leave the Casino property.\\n\\nIt was very inappropriate with the bad service that we received from the server and the fact that he aggressively snatched a cup from my wife, then proceeded to AGGRESSIVELY TOUCH A CUSTOMER - shove into me with his shoulder while staring me down and then curse at my family at the table.  I tried to contact LBS Burger to follow up and make sure that this employee was dealt with appropriately, but they have been silent.\\n\\nNever again. \\n\\nEver.",

It is all typical steakhouse fare but with lots of choices and executed very well.  The typical blue cheese wedge is so decadent with large chunks of cheese and caramelized bacon, all other wedge salads will not do it for you in the future.  The lobster bisque is sweet and creamy and is a must have each time you go.  \\n\\nImportant hint: don't pass up dessert - a true quality restaurant will have a well rounded and exciting dessert menu.  Delmonico's never fails.  My favorite is anything chocolate/peanut butter or Baily's Irish cream inspired.  This restaurant always seems to have something like this on their menu.

So what is the first thing I'm craving?  A burger, of course.  So, BurGR it is.  \\n\\nService:  \\nUnique situation when we arrived for dinner.  It was around 5 PM on Easter and they were closed.  Apparently, BurGR had a small fire the night before and all the inspections kept them from opening on time. Not a big deal to me.  Safety first, right?  Once they opened for business, we were seated right away and our orders were taken fairly quick.  Our waitress was attentive and kept our drinks full.  So far, so good. \\n\\nThe Food:\\n-American Burger:  I'm old fashion when it comes to a beef burger and decided to keep it simple.  But I also needed to make up for being meatless for so long.  So, I had them add an extra patty.  This was perfect, this was huge.  My burger was cooked medium-well and it was both tasty & juicy.  My only regret...wish I didn't get this with cheese.  The cheese was a little salty and took away from the burger. I managed to eat the whole thing.  Obviously, I was satisfied.  Obviously, I recommend.  \\n\\n-Sweet Potato Fries:  This was Ty W's and Lore D's order.  But that didn't stop me from taking a few pieces.  I thought that these were pretty good. They hook up the fries here.  It's big enough for 4.  \\n\\n-Truffle Parmesan Fries:  I read reviews that this is really good. I thought that they were just okay.  Maybe it's the batch that we got.  I just thought that the ones that I had were a little under cooked.  Still tasted good, though. \\n\\nOverall, I recommend BurGR if you're craving a decent burger.  Price is about average to what you expect to pay in a restaurant on the strip, especially one owned by Gordon Ramsay.  \\n\\nPS:  I had another great dinner with Terri R (who happened to come here last year after giving up red meat for 40 days), Terri's teen, Ty W, Lore D, and their son.

They serve it to you in a cup or a mini cone, your choice, they even have a chocolate waffle cone for you to choose from.

The seasoned potatoes without doubt MY FAVORITE things on the menu. Sure you seasoned potatoes at any breakfast joint but the thing stands out for me is the seasoning mix they put on them. I have no idea it is. All I know is potatoes are addicting could eat plate of potatoes be in complete bliss. I put some ketchup on them but really tasty eat them by themselves. They nice HOT. Crispy on the outside. I also had the sandwiches on the menu are solid and makes for great breakfast/lunch.

The first time I went in, I had them balance all 4 tires.  I was very wary because when I was waiting for them to write up the service order, the attendant didn't know how to ring in the service.  When he asked his associate, that second guy told him to write it up at a lower price than the guy I was talking to quoted me.  When I asked, he gave me some excuse that right now I don't even remember.  It wasn't too big of a difference, but I still remember feeling a little ripped off because of course I was made to pay the higher price.  \\n\\nThe real problem happened when I returned a couple weeks later to get an alignment as the balancing did not fix the problem.  All seemed to be going well until I was about to be picked up by my girlfriend.  The mechanic who was going to test drive the car backed out of the parking spot I was in.  She was pulling into the parking lot at the same time coming down the aisle.  The mechanic proceeded to hammer the gas pedal, squealing the tires and almost hitting my girlfriend head on as he maneuvered around her and out of the parking lot.  Needless to say I was furious and confronted the manager.  He assured me that it would be handled.  \\n\\nWhen we were leaving, the mechanic pulled into the parking lot making an ILLEGAL left turn into the parking lot which was blocked by a median.  Instead of going to the nearest light and making a safe and legal u-turn, he decided to make the left heading up the wrong side of the road.  I was livid at this point.  I approached the mechanic in my car and his response was that he did not squeal the tires and that he makes that turn all the time basically asking me what the big deal was.  The manager came up to me giving me his best effort to rectify the situation by promising me a free oil change on my next visit.  REALLY?!?!?!? I told him that I perform my own oil changes and just to fix my car.\\n\\nWhen I went back to pick up my car, the manager continued to assure me that everything would be taken care of and offered apologies.  He gave me his best effort I guess, but his resolution was to charge me full price for the awful experience I had just gone through and to give me a free oil change on my next visit which will NEVER happen even after I told him that I change my own oil.  \\n\\nWell, my shimmy problem is still not fixed,  which there might be something wrong with the rotors, still haven't figured that out.  I don't hold the continued problem against them, they performed the work I asked them to do, but of course there was no diagnosis of the actual problem or extra effort.  Kinda feels like I just got a hardly satisfying haircut at Super Clips or something.  Their only concern is getting cars in and out of the shop, not developing lifelong customers.  I received no comfort by the actions of their mechanic while driving my car.  If I saw him peel out in my car, almost hit my girlfriend, and perform an illegal left turn in the 5 seconds I saw him driving my car, what kind of driving maneuvers is he doing while he's out of sight and what other corners is he cutting while performing work on my car?\\n\\nI will never be going back to this shop or any other Tire Works shops for any service even if it is given to me for free.

We attempted to call LSI housekeeping around 11AM to request turndown service while we would be away from our room. The phone line was busy for 10min, when we finally got through, we only got an answering machine.

So, I am NOT subtracting points for an occasional sticky table and the lack of waitresses in bikinis... it's a dive with good food and cheap beer, and a 4 star for what it does.

The place appears to be clean (important to me!) and they are fast and friendly. My pink and white nails looked great when I was done. They're a little more pointy-corner square than I usually like, but not a big deal. \\n\\nSo here's what annoyed me. First, instead of filing off the old acrylic they way my usual salon does, this guy chipped it away with nippers. I know every nail tech has their own preferred ways of doing things, but doing it like this hurts, and it really chews up the natural nail. Then, to shorten the length, he chopped them off with a nail cutter instead of filing them. Faster, but in the process he broke my thumb nail, which he then informed me had have all the acrylic removed as a result. THEN he charged me for a nail repair- for the nail that HE BROKE. It's not a lot of money, but it annoyed me... a LOT ... that I had to pay for a problem he created. After the fill, I had the world's fastest pedicure. Another woman, who was his next fill client, was getting a pedicure that started 15 minutes before mine started in the chair next to her. My pedicure was done before hers. Seriously- it was MAYBE 15 minutes total. Now there are times when I don't mind someone who's fast, but come ON. A fifteen minute pedicure??? It's supposed to be relaxing! He didn't leave out any steps, mind you, and it looks ok, but he literally flew through the whole process, not really paying attention to details or really doing anything more than cursory, superficial work. I won't say I'd never get another pedicure here, but I would NOT have him do it. I was really disappointed. \\n\\nWhen I went to pay and he charged me extra to fix the nail he broke, I just decided that would come out of his tip. I am sure he just thought I was being cheap and didn't realize how annoyed I really was. Oh well- vote with your wallet, right?",
