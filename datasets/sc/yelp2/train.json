I ate every scrap of mine, as did my dad. The sweet potato fries were the only sub-perfect component - this is one of the few things I would have changed, perhaps substituted a small salad.\\n\\nTHE SERVICE: This may have been due to the fact that we were the only customers for the first half-hour, but we had our own busboy in addition to the waiter, and the GM came over to inquire personally how we were doing. This led into a charming conversation about her history in Vietnam, of fleeing the country and working her way up in the United States.

We were there for 1.5 hours total, and had time for only 1 drink because of the poor service. We were thinking that perhaps we were on a \\\"hidden camera\\\" show because we truly felt ignored. The worst thing, however, was a long hair found in one of my group's dish. I know it does happen, and was thankful it wasn't my dish! Having complained about service, I must say that the food was quite good. Sadly, the service really pulled the star rating way down.

Which is how the restaurant was presented on \\\"Check Please, Arizona.\\\"  So we were positive at the outset.  \\n\\nUnfortunately, our entire experience here was akin to sitting through a 0-star movie simply for the stubborn fact that we'd paid admission and wanted to see how it ended (although we couldn't wait for that end to arrive).\\n\\nVery nice, welcoming interior.  Service was . . . disinterested?  Not horrendous, not good, not passable, just . . . bleh?\\n\\nArrived at 1 PM on a Saturday and the place was pretty empty.  Ordered quickly--and the food took 35 minutes to arrive.  This was disappointing . . . and I will further expound on this later in the review.\\n\\nFlammenkuchen:  never had this before, so can't say if it is \\\"genuine\\\" or not, but it really wasn't anything spectacular.  Just kind of a doughy pizza with apples and bacon on top rather than cheese and sauce.  It was tasty . . . but really not something I'd like to eat again.  Certainly not a dish that brought the house down.\\n\\nDessert Crepes:  they were OK.  Not the best I've ever had, but they were tasty and we didn't leave anything behind.\\n\\nSweet Potato Fries:  again, OK.  Not the worst I've ever had, but certainly not meriting the gushing review given them on \\\"Check Please.\\\"\\n\\nThe most frustrating/disappointing part of this whole ordeal was the La Bressane.  The waiter attempted to explain what this was to me when I ordered, but he certainly did not do justice to the most ludicrous dining experience I've ever been exposed to in my entire life.  He brought out a pot of hot oil, a burner, a plate with ~4 ounces of various dipping sauces, a bowl of bread crumbs, some skewers, and a 7-oz chicken breast cut into 20 or so pieces.  His explanation:  skewer the chicken, roll in bread crumbs, cook in the oil for 30-60 seconds, dip in sauce, eat, repeat.  OK.  Sounds great in theory.\\n\\nThis, of course, begs the question of why, if all the chef had to do was cut a chicken breast into 20+ pieces, did it take 35 minutes for my food to arrive after ordering?\\n\\nWell, it turns out that 30-60 seconds in the oil leaves the chicken raw.  Actually takes 3-5 minutes for each piece to cook.  Which meant that I had to fight with this pot of boiling oil for over 90 MINUTES in order to successfully consume 7 ounces of chicken.  As I was so ravenous, I kept burning my mouth with the chicken which, I discovered, when soaked in boiling oil for 3-5 minutes takes forever to cool to eating temperature.\\n\\nAbout halfway through this enraging process, I discovered that my cooking oil was disappearing.  Of course it was--it was soaking into the chicken, which was then being transferred to my stomach.  So the last half of the meal took almost twice as long to cook as the first half did, as I was depleting my \\\"cooking medium.\\\"\\n\\nI have observed animal behavior experiments in college where lab rats had to work less for their food than I did for this meal.  \\n\\nAnd then, for the rest of the day, after ingesting at least a cup's worth of cooking oil I was rewarded with some of the most noxious intestinal fumes I have ever smelled.  Couple that with 6 hours of diarrhea the following day and the tale is complete.\\n\\nBut . . . not quite.  $60 (2 people, no drinks) and 2 hours wasted on this ridiculously laughable dining experience.  Not sure how that price can be considered fair . . . since I, Joe Schmoe, basically COOKED MY OWN MEAL!\\n\\nMaybe mine was an isolated experience, but the food, service, and ambiance were not such that I will waste that amount of time, money, and energy on Le Chalet ever again.\\n\\nPS:  I see a lot of reviews here stating they serve \\\"French cuisine.\\\"  I was led to believe that it was Swiss.  It was certainly nothing like any of the other French restaurants I have frequented in 3 different countries (not France).  Unless it mimics a specific \\\"region\\\" in France?",

        "sentence": "I stayed here on April 20 thru 22, 2012. I wanted to like this hotel since it has the modern appeal, but that's pretty much the only thing it's got going for it is the looks... I stayed at the 2 bedroom Hospitality suite with a group of friends for my weekend party. The biggest room they offered. Everyone liked the suite and the size is about 1600 sq ft for $800/nt. The view was nice we were facing Mandalay Bay and the I-15 freeway. \\n\\nThe problem was with the front desk/staff they were absolutely horrible. I had called a day in advance to tell them I will be there the next evening so save me the corner Hospitality suite. The girl tells me sure we could that for you... I got there Friday evening to check-in the Front Desk guy Anthony (this is a shout out for you) was rude and did not greet any of the guests. I walked up to him and I said 'hi' he couldn't even squeeze a hello or a smile or anything. Someone must've rolled off the wrong side of the bed this morning. I told him I called and requested for a corner Hospitality suite, without checking his computer he gave me a quick answer no. I was like, what's the point of calling in and making a request if you guys don't even care for it? I'm not even asking for an upgrade this is more of a lateral move from one Hospitality suite to another. I did not want to start my stay here haggling with this guy, so I asked for my keys and moved on.\\n\\nSo my group and I got the room and we found out that they we needed an extra rollaway bed so that a couple of the guys won't need to sleep on the floor. I called the housekeeping, they forwarded to front desk, and front desk guy says they don't have any roll away beds. Wow, I'm astonished by what they told me. I asked him seriously in a new facility this big and you don't even have a single rollaway bed? I asked to speak with the manager; with a little talk they finally dropped off a roll away bed which they told me they have none... it was like pulling someone arm. I was beginning to think what kind of Hospitality these guys are really offering. More like lame excuses/poor service and zero hospitality. \\n\\nThese were actually the minor issues we had the real problems are to come next...\\n\\nThe lobby is tiny compared to the other nearby hotels i.e. Aria, Cosmo, and Mandarin, and not to mention the Vdara was very difficult to get to by foot or by car. By car you would really have to slow down or stop your car to look for a single sign that points you to a single lane ramp that takes you to the front of the Vdara. By foot some of the sidewalks are closed off and you have to walk through the Cosmo casino to get back to Vdara from the strip. So either way by foot or by car it is actually difficult to get to Vdara. Seems like an engineering blunder when they attempted to link Vdara to the Las Vegas Strip.\\n\\nVdara staff/house cleaning STOLE $500 from our room. I reported this to their front desk, security, and risk management, all were quick to make excuses and give me the run around. No one cooperated. The front desk girl Kelli even refused to give me her hotel manager's name and refused to let me talk to her..... She wouldn't even let me talk to her assistant manager! She kept me on the phone for an hour and nothing came out of it..... just more frustration. The theft was reported on Monday 4/23/2012, I waited a week they did nothing and they found nothing. I told security just check who entered my room on 4/20/2012 between 11pm - 2am. They have surveillance and an advanced key card system. Yet they did absolutely nothing to help out. \\n\\nI live in California; I go to Vegas often like 3 times a year often in various different hotels casinos going on 11 years now. Never, have I had this many problems with a single hotel. This is by far the first of all-times low in overall Vegas experience. \\n\\nThe LAST problem was they over charged my credit card; they charged $1050 when the rate was $800 with their lousy Resort Fees and taxes. I had to call and tell them to correct the issue complained some more. This was corrected 2 days later. As you could imagine, I had enough of Vdara - they STEAL, they LIE, they FAIL.",

This is probably because Las Vegas diners come out pretty late for dinner and dining rooms are pretty empty until 7 p.m. hits.\\n\\nThe service is not particularly friendly, but I'm never really impressed by overly enthusiastic waiters anyway, so that was fine by me. One exception was the server who came around with bread. He was so enthusiastic about his bread. Lol. Great guy. \\n\\nMy husband and I both had the filet mignon with truffle sauce. It arrived...warmish, not hot. We had to remind the server we also had the truffle sauce, which came in a separate sauce boat. It arrived after the reminder.

It came out in a circle, with real Mediterranean EVOO in the middle. When I first tried it, it tasted like SOUR CREAM, but I still knew it was Yogurt! VERY thick, rich and creamy. It is Greek-style, only much much better!\\n\\nWith my dish, I got their Hummus which was very creamy and flavorful. Also got their Baba Ghannouj (eggplant puree) which was also yummy.\\n\\nDessert was a real treat! Had the Kenafeh, which was a sweet cheese topped with what they called \\\"shredded wheat.\\\" Silly me, I was thinking of the cereal and thought that would be weird! But thankfully, it was NOT cereal but rather a smooth, silky mixutre which added to the sweet cheese flavor. Never had this one before, and it was delicious! Oh, and it was not nearly as \\\"heavy\\\" as one would expect from a cheese dish.\\n\\nMy only \\\"negative\\\" is that the wine prices are quite high. Guess that is normal for Uptown. But it prevented me from ordering a bottle when I knew that their markup was 100% (meaning double retail). Also the waiter was awfully young and didn't know that Greece was in the Mediterranean region because of a question I asked.

Largest club in the US or something like that, eh? Didn't really feel like it, but then again everything in Vegas is huge so it's difficult to tell what large is. \\n\\nSpeaking of large, the chunky asses and cottage cheese thighs on the majority of the dancers didn't sit well with us. There were so many girls though, it wasn't the worst thing about it. No... the worst thing was that we both had to pay the 30 dollar cover (because there was a male show there also). \\n\\nBear in mind that we're from Phoenix where the lapdances are of higher quality and than what we had at this joint and they cost half the price... cover is also free for women or 10 bucks for men where we are. Drinks at this place were disturbingly overpriced. We had what was apparently boxed wine at 12 bucks a glass. After 4 rounds, the waitress told us we should've gotten a bottle - cheapest one was 120 bucks (um... if you can pour 8 glasses of wine out of one bottle of wine you should change your name to Jesus and start up a magic show on the strip).\\n\\nAlso make note that we did a lot wrong that night... it was our first vegas strip club experience and didn't have the handbook. I'm sure there were cheaper ways to get drinks, but we didn't know about them. \\n\\nAnyway - so the dancers weren't all that great for the most part. The worst part about that though was that even though we had a decent seat in a high traffic area, we got no attention. When we did get attention, I got shitty lapdances. They were so standard, I wanted to tell them to stop halfway through. In front of me, a group of dudes were getting the works - legs over the shoulder, panties moved around, allowed to be grabby. Me? no. My girlfriend got some pretty good ones though.\\n\\nWe were told by some that it was because we were a couple and that some girls don't like to dance for couples because they are afraid the girlfriend might freak out and get mad. Others said they thought I already was with a dancer... hmm...  Anyway - we had to ask the door guy at one point about it because we went an hour and a half without a girl even looking at us. He sent over the first chubby girl he could find... couldn't turn her down at that point. \\n\\nAs the night went on, we started to get more dances - we had to be aggressive in finding the girls though. Lapdances were still shit for me though. We finally found a girl we both fell in love with and who seemed to fall in love with us - so we took her to the VIP area... pricey and not as private as I imagined. We were told by several girls who tried to upsell us that we could do more up there - psh... not much more from a guy's point of view - but she did some naughty things to my girlfriend. It was a lot of fun at least.  Don't know if the whole experience was worth every penny, but we don't have much to compare it to since this is the only strip club we visited in Vegas. Next time we're doing more research. \\n\\nWe did find out that many dancers are from other states and just come out here on the weekends because they can make up to 2k a night... shit - a couple weekends or so a month and you could turn 6 figures a year easy. Now I understand a little why some of those girls were such stuck up bitches. Compared to the handful of clubs I've been to around Phoenix, I have to give the overall quality of the vegas local dancers a 2/5... we had a few who were just in from out of town who we liked a lot, but really we would only return to this club to try to find that VIP girl again. Otherwise we're never going back.\\n\\nKid Rock showed up that night too... still doesn't elevate this place above a 2 from a couple's perspective... judging from the experience the guys around us were having though - I'd have to give it more stars.",

Still had the water feature in the lobby which makes it smell musty and dirty, but all of the rooms are laid out around an outdoor pool and the doors all open to the outside - either overlooking the pool on the inner court, or the parking and freeway on the south side outer court.  they don't give you an option when you reserve!  I'm a Hilton Rewards member and my profile always says I want the least noisy option since I am a light sleeper - ie. the highest floor so I don't have kids jumping on my ceiling, and away from the elevator to avoid that noise, as well as the late nite partiers getting off the elevator and early morning business conversations. I got put in a 2nd (of 3) floor room, on the outer court. (I'd also asked when I made ressie to have our party of 4 rooms (10 people) in the same area.) When we got there they said there was no mention of it, even though it wasstated on my confirmation page.  they said they could not accommodate without charging more money.  Turns out after going to a late lunch, and picking up another family member from the airport, i went back to the room, and realized the air con wasn't working.  So back down with the luggage to get a new room.  Finally at that time they gave two of the four of our rooms together, but we were at the very far end of the property and had to walk a mile to get to the lobby, breakfast, etc.  At least the air in these rooms worked. the rooms are outdated, and dirty.  the carpet is worn and smelly and dirty.  the bathroom floor tile grout was filthy and smelled like stinky feet.  the lighting is horrible in the vanity area, even with the window drapes completely open on a sunny day.  there are very few electrical outlets, and none in good areas for doing business (no desk), or for blow drying out in the \\\"dining\\\" area to keep the noise down for the people still sleeping.  the layout has the toilet and the shower in one \\\"jack and jill\\\" layout between the living space and the bedroom, but the vanity/sink is open to the bed area.  The beds were very comfortable, although we all prefer the duvet covers to be white/clean.  The pool area is a plus - however the towels they give you are really tea towels, not pool towels.  this was laffable. it is nice you can order from the restaurant and they'll bring drinks and food out to the pool.  the free breakfast is really good...not much more they could offer, 6:30am-9:30am weekdays..  the happy hour was great for the drinks and lots of room to sit with a large group, but the snacks were far less in variety and volume than other Embassy locations...really just chips and salsa, and not the normal spread.It was also very humid and warm in the lobby area, and it was only in the '80s that day.  I think this is a good hotel for families with young children who can thrash the place and have a priority to play in the pool, or for college age groups who are on a budget.

The products are just \\\"okay,\\\" but in my opinion, they should be top-notch at $60+ per pair for kids' shoes! The owners do not stand behind their products, so don't expect them to care if your child's shoe breaks within the first five times of wearing them. The employees also act like jerks if you ask to see shoes that are on sale.\\n\\nThe fact is that I took advantage of their big sale in late Aug/Sept. when I purchased three pairs of shoes, which is the only reason it took so long to realize that one of the pairs was defective. I hardly ever return things because it is usually more hassle than it's worth, but in this case I thought it was warranted due to the brand of shoe and the caliber of store. I felt that if I was the owner, I would not have wanted my customer to only get five uses (not even whole days each use) out of shoes purchased at my store. However, the reason I was so upset was not that my daughter's shoe was defective (hey, things happen!) It was the attitude of the employee. I have been a manager in the retail, service, and restaurant industries and I was absolutely appalled and offended by her tone and overall attitude. She actually said, \\\"if we just replaced every defective shoe....\\\" Then, she said there was nothing more she could do for me. I had to then leave the store and call the shoe manufacturer myself, who told me they'd be glad to fix it and apologized like any decent business does, whether they want to or not! Then I had to make 2 more trips to the store after that so that Kixx could send the shoes to the manufacturer for repair per the manufacturer's instructions. I don't live close by, so it would have been nice if Kixx offered to ship the shoes back to me after the repair was made...Buyer beware! They are sweet as pie until you encounter a problem!  \\n\\n***Update- 7/3/13- The owner of this store is now harassing me via email to take down my HONEST review.

Trying to take one bite meant having all of the meat fall of the bone effortlessly.\\n\\nBeer selection here is good, with Brooklyn Lager, Ballast Point, Ommegang and Green flash being offered on draft.  Drafts I've had ranged from $4-$6; not too bad.  Bottle selection is decent too, including Deschutes, Kona, Dogfish Head, Duvel and Stone.  You can also get a flight of three beers for $10.  How many sports bars do that?\\n\\nOutside of food and drink, they also have a Tuesday night pub quiz that starts at 7:00pm.  On Wednesday nights they have two rounds of darts tournaments, at 7:30pm and 12:30am.  I haven't been to either event, but the main reason I first came here was to play darts, and they are serious about it.  An entire wall lined with cork holds four steel tip dart boards, and the throwing line is built into the floor; it's not just a strip of tape on the ground.  House darts are of better quality than at other bars, but it seems that most people who come here to play bring their own dart sets; again, people are serious about it here, and it's a cool spot that caters to it.\\n\\nWhile not located in my neighborhood, the combination of good food, good beer, and good darts has easily made this a locals bar that is worth driving to.  Not only is this a sports bar that the southwest deserves, it's one that it needs.  Proof that a bar does not need to be a generic, cookie cutter chain that starts with a P and end with a T.",

The latest golden child of the Vegas Yelp community is Frost Bites Shavery, which serves up snow cream. And I am thrilled to say that Frost Bites Shavery completely lives up to the hype!! (And, not gonna lie, I am pretty stoked that it's out in Old Henderson on Boulder Highway cuz that's my 'hood!)\\n\\nI had no clue what snow cream was, and was so pleasantly surprised by the taste and texture when Jaime W. and I stopped by on a Saturday to try it out. The side of the Frost Bites truck describes snow cream as \\\"when ice cream and shaved ice fell in love, got married, and had a baby\\\" which sums it up perfectly. This is nothing like the crunchy, sickeningly sweet, artificially flavored snow cones some places are serving up. Frost Bites snow cream is light and airy while remaining creamy and rich... And the best part? It's ALL NATURAL. It's also surprisingly low calorie!! \\n\\nThe owners, Will and Mike, explained that each flavor only has 4 ingredients and they do not use any powders to flavor their cream. So, as much as they would like to offer other flavors, they chose to stick with only offering up what they can make naturally which I think is amazing. I wish more places were like this. The same is true with their toppings, only fresh fruits are offered up here, no 'frost bitten' strawberries to be found here!\\n\\nAfter trying almost every favor, I settled on coconut. Topped with pineapple, mochi and condensed milk it tasted like I was on a tropical island, not sitting in a parking lot overlooking Boulder Highway. It was so delicious, I had to go back the next day for another one, and I am already planning what flavor combinations to try on my future visits. \\n\\nWill and Mike are extremely friendly, kind and professional guys... Will was very open and honest with us about what toppings he recommends with what flavors, which he does not recommend, and he even said he would work on getting some popping boba as a topping!! They really want honest feedback, and I never have a problem with giving constructive criticism, but there is really nothing to improve upon here. More chairs to sit in perhaps? \\n\\nHendertucky may not be your 'hood, but I promise you that no matter what part of town you live in, Frost Bites is worth the drive.

Second, it seems almost impossible to shop here if you don't have a designer in tow.  No wonder the stores are almost always empty.\\n\\nHere's how you shop without a designer on retainer:\\n\\n1.  Browse all the stores open to the public.  Make a note of what you're seriously interested in.  I'd recommend checking out Four Hands.  The stuff in there is really cool -- it's the kind of stuff you'd see in Restoration Hardware, Pottery Barn, etc, with an industrial edge.\\n\\n2.  Tell the store employee what you're interested but emphasize that you don't have a designer.  Ask them if someone at Las Vegas Design Center can help you (that's the interior designers on staff).  You can always avoid this step and just go directly to LVDC.\\n\\n3.  Tell one of the LVDC designers that you're interested in purchasing certain items.  The designer can decipher the price tags for you.   \\n\\nUsually, the designer can buy the items for half of the retail price.  She'll then charge you 20% of her cost for the item.  You'll then pay for shipping --this is not a cash and carry place.  Also, note, if you pay with a credit card, you'll be charged a fee. \\n\\nEven after all these charges, I got the same type of coffee table sold at Restoration Hardware for half the price (Four Hands).   I also bought a crapload of really cool artwork, stuff you will not find ANYWHERE else in Las Vegas (Leftbank).  Once I had the designer helping me, purchasing everything was a snap.\\n\\n**Please note that the designers at LVDC offer one hour of shopping assistance for free.  After that, you're paying for their time.  However, as I knew exactly what I wanted before I talked to the designer, it wasn't an issue for me.  I ended up getting some really cool artwork and furniture for a pretty low price.  They made money and I saved money, so, it's a win win.  I will definitely go back for some more shopping considering the quality and selection.\\n\\nDon't be afraid to shop here, it's not so difficult after all!",

Our first time walking to this place, we took our puppy so she could get some exercise, so the menu out in front was a good perk.  Their portions size was very generous. My fiance got the tofu with eggplant in garlic sauce.  Delicious! A bit spicy but not overwhelming.  I got the sweet and sour shrimp.  Again, portion was great.  I loved that they put the sweet and sour sauce on the side. I tend to eat in small portions, but all the time, which, if the sauce was already mixed in, the shrimp would have been super soggy.  This allows me to put how much sauce I want in and keep my food longer without worry of the soggy factor.  Another plus was that they have Honey Walnut Shrimp.  Yes, you can get this at many Chinese food establishments, but seeing as how I hate driving in Las Vegas and this dish tends to be pricey, I'm glad to find a place close-by that sells it for a decent price (less than $15).

My experiences with Fremont street thus far had been The Beauty Bar and The Griffin. To say that I wasn't a fan of Fremont Street was an understatement. The Griffin is basically the Blue Martini of hipsters, and Beauty Bar charges a cover to hang out with underage kiddies with fake ID's in a hole in the wall with music so loud that you can't think. Don't Tell Mama is the antithesis of that, it's filled with creative interesting people that are a tad eccentric. We walk in and are surprised to see a piano and a girl belting Take Me or Leave Me from Rent at the front of their mini stage. We both think, okay this is our kinda bar! I ordered a flavored vodka and sprite and Matt had a vodka cranberry, which came out to $13. So definitely not overpriced, you're crazy Matt. I think one of my favorite things about Don't Tell Mama was the fact that the bartenders are the singers. Yes, I got served my Stoli Blackberry and Sprite straight in the middle of  the bartender belting out a song on a wireless mic, AMAZ-ING. Sexual orientation shouldn't matter in a bar, but I will comment that it does have a heavily female vibe. If that bothers you, this probably isn't your place. The music of the night included a couple tunes from Cher, Elton John, Billy Joel, Rush, Rent, and TLC. There was even a patron who belted out some Georgia on my Mind by Ray Charles.Yes they are heavily karaoke, but trust me on this, it's done phenomenally well. Truth be told, no matter how much I like this place I question it's ability to have longevity. It caters to a completely different crowd, it's small, known as a lesbian bar, and is on Fremont Street.

His Taco was very flavorful & had a perfectly crisp shell.  the toppings were also in perfect proportions as to not fall all over the place when eaten...mmmm but did that taco have a ton of juice drip when he bit!  you know its moist when they do that!\\nAlso, in addition... Service was impeccable, not hovering but whenever we needed a refill or had plates to clear someone appeared.

They came closer with my plate, I could hear angels singing, and as soon as they set it down I deflated. I had two silver dollar sized cakes with an extremely large amount of greens on my plate. My husband and I each got three bites between the two cakes, and they were very small bites. I paid $10 for this?\\n\\nFifth strike: Our meals came out within 5 minutes of our appetizer (sigh), and again the portion sizes were disappointing. My steak was cooked appropriately, but it was the only one at the table that was cooked correctly. My husband ordered the lamb shank, and it was tough and poorly seasoned. My mother in law had the lasagna, which was cold. The only person who enjoyed their meal was my sister, who ordered roasted chicken.\\n\\nBetween the poor service, the inability to honor our reservation properly, the awful drinks, the long waits, and the bad food, I'm amazed that this restaurant is so well reviewed. The amount we paid for this awful meal makes it twice as bad. I will definitely never be back to this restaurant. The fact that there were less than 10 occupied tables at what would normally be the dinner rush on a Friday night speaks volumes, and now I know why.",

Restaurants are driven by customers and how you treat your customers will determine how well you will do.

In this economy restaurants are NOT a necessity and people will go where they are taken care of, as well as for the food.

Dr Marquez was  just as sweet and a true professional. I felt immediately comfortable with her and could tell she really loves what she does, impressed by her expertise and attention to detail. Honestly, the best eye exam I've ever had...quite the eye opener beyond the obvious.\\n\\nBoth Dr. Marquez and Brian worked as a team to help me decide on the perfect frame. They have various price points which I can see being attractive to someone one on a tight budget and the lower price point designs are comparable to the high price point options. You mean I can pay almost close to nothing  and I don't have to look like Ronnie Milsap or feel positively goofy like Jan Brady?......SWEET!\\n\\nI was having such a tough time deciding which frames to go with when I decided just to go with the top two I liked the most. One set will be my business look and the other will be my sporty trying to look smart look. \\n\\nI'll be back in a couple weeks for a contact exam and fitting. \\n\\nYay for us!",

I circled the building a couple times and probably would have just gone home, but I decided to go in the bar (Paradise Poker) and ask the bartender where this place was, since bartenders generally know everything.  Turns out, it's right next to the bar, but you can't see it until you actually get out of your car.   I was there with a group of friends celebrating a birthday, and on paper, this seemed like a great place for a party.  They have 2 arcade games and an xbox hooked up on the big screen.  One of the arcade games was broken and my friend had to mess with the TV for a while to get the xbox to work (notice my friend was doing this, not the employees).  The place, although colorfully decorated, was pretty dirty.  It looked like the floor hadn't been swept all day.  The employees working were a bunch of young guys who seemed to care more about hanging out with each other than serving the customers.  One of their friends was just hanging out there drinking a tall can of bud light (do they have the proper license for that??), and they would rather talk to him than the customers.  We all got in line to order our food.  I ordered first and tried to get the pulled pork slider.  He told me they were out of pork.  So I went with the \\\"mystery\\\" slider, the barby, and the pep pep.  Apparently they charge $2 extra (almost the price of another slider) for the mystery slider.  He did not mention this to me when ordering.  Like I said, I ordered first out of the group, but everyone else (6-7 orders) got their food before I got mine.  Obviously they forgot about my order.  Almost a half hour later I finally got my sliders.  The employee tried to high five me when he finally brought it out.  No \\\"sorry for the wait sir\\\" or anything remotely professional.  Most of my friends were almost done eating at this point.  So now to the food: The barby slider was by far the best out of the three.  The pep pep was also good.  The mystery slider that cost me $5 was just a piece of meat with two fried, overcooked stuffed jalapenos on it.  I took one bite and tossed it.  To top it all off, about 20 minutes after leaving I had a mean case of the sh*ts.   I'll never go there again, and I'd advise anyone who values customer service to avoid this place like the plague.",

When our server Javier came to the table we told him about the menu situation and he seem less than bothered and never took care of the problem.  Luckily one of us had hand sanitizer with us and we proceeded to clean our own menus so we could order! While we were ordering the server seemed more interested in watching the people walk by the patio than on giving us his attention.  Food was pretty good.  Water glasses were never refilled.  Server did not check on us regularly.  One of the members in our party went into the restaurant to speak with a manager about the sub standard service. The server Javier saw us speaking with the manager and without finding out what our complaint was; WENT TO OUR TABLE AND CONFRONTED MY PARENTS WHO ARE VISITING FROM OUT OF TOWN AND SAID, 'WELL I HEAR YOU WEREN'T HAPPY?\\\"  The manager was very apologetic and comped our meal but we could not believe that the server confronted the table!  I have worked in Food and Beverage myself for years but have never experienced or observed such rudeness from a server.   Although the manager tried to recover us I will never return to the Cantina Loredo and I would suggest that anyone reading this to go spend their hard earned money elsewhere!",

The bar top was packed while the main area had a steady flow of patrons ordering, dining, enjoying then leaving.

Seems like they might have it sitting stove top somewhere. It took longer for our rice to show up, but it was definitely worth it. The rice was tasty, as are most fried foods. Fluffy and moist with bits and pieces of meat, egg and dashes of spice. \\n\\nAs far as the ramen goes, there was a taste I can't quite describe.. it wasn't necessarily bad nor was it good. What saved the bowl, in my opinion, was the fact that they include a little sriracha style chili sauce which blended well in the broth and masked that indescribable taste. That, along with garlic and a dab of soy totally turned this dish from a 3 to a 4. The spice level, out of 10, had to be in the 5 or 6 zone. ALMOST had me, but it was more of a flavor than the actual kick. The ramen noodles were a little thin making it truly easy to finish this bowl off, which I find hard to do in the SGV area due to the portion sizes.\\n\\nThis wasn't necessarily the best ramen I've had to date, but having the wind gust hard outside along with winter like temps and an empty stomach, it definitely did the job..

Maybe this Is a good place to have drinks and some selectful apps, but do not waste your time with dinner or lunch for that matter. This place will not survive.

Why 2 stars? We arrived at 5:45 p.m. on a blistering 113 degree Saturday night and were told we would be seated in 2-3 hours. Ok. Not great, but ok. The scam is that you have to wait at their bar next door or be forced to check in every hour. By their time calculations we should have been seated around 8:15 p.m. Guess when we sat down to dinner, folks? 9:30 p.m. We spent that time spending $$ in their not-so-well-cooled bar with not very many seats. Nice way to get 2 tabs out of one evening, restaurant owners! Once we were seated in the actual restaurant, we also sat at a bar. We love bar seating--however, this bar has one side with leg room, the other side has no leg room. Our awesome luck continuing, I was wearing a skirt, and guess which side we were seated at? It was not a good arrangement. Their waiters didn't feel like waiters, more like expediters working the floor. After suffering through the indignity of an outrageously long wait, one of these expediters didn't approach us for another 10 minutes. Now it's 9:40-ish. Finally we get service, which was on the gruff side. I still can't sit at the bar quite right, so when a couple leaves the other side of the bar (the side that has leg room), I approach the manger to see if we can move. Perhaps a tiny victory, but a victory nonetheless. We spend the next 20 minutes talking about the very good pizza in an set up that hucks the bucks from those who wait...and everyone does. Even though we enjoyed the pizza, we won't be going back. Tip: the bald bartender said their slowest season/slowest nights were May-September, Wednesdays and Thursdays.

No big deal, they weren't that busy, but it was weird that they argued with me that I'd already been seated when I was standing in front of them.\\n\\nSo they said they'd prepare another table while we waited patiently in the bar.  After 30 minutes, no one came to get us so we checked in again...and finally got our table.  You know it's a bad sign when the first thing out of your server's mouth is a giant sigh.

After being pressured into ordering beverages, we finally got menus.\\n\\nThe menus are pretty simple and don't go into a lot of detail.  When the server came back he asked if we would like for him to talk about the menu.  We said yes and he proceeded to explain that they had a tasting menu and an a la carte.  And that was it.  When we asked for suggestions, he muttered something about being really busy.  Then he asked where we were from in a condescending tone.  Ummm...really?  WTF difference does it make?!

They kept asking if we were ready but wouldn't answer any questions.  At that point, the bread guy was looking like he'd be a more promising server.  It was seriously like pulling teeth.

What is with this place and fingerling potatoes anyway?  They're in everything, but anyway).  My veal loin was overcooked despite my ordering it prepared as the chef saw fit and it was lukewarm.

The main dude- kinda heavy set with a flat top says \\\"Hi, you guys got reservations?\\\"  That really pisses me off, calling my hot girlfriend a guy.  No...we didn't have reservations.  So...I take the little plastic buzzer and he says it will take 30-45 mins.  I decide to order some dranks as the bar.  When I go up for the second round at the bar for drinks, the chicka dees at the bar are all gawking at how cool my mustache is.  Two douchers walk up behind me, one has total respect for the stache and the other must have had too much to drink because he got in my bubble when I was trying to order my drinks.

We just want to eat.  So....I say right off the bat..Could we please get two waters?  He points to our table and says  \\\"There's two waters right there.\\\"  His tone, his attitude, etc. made me have a Viet Nam Flash back.

Talk about wanting to chokeslam a doucher for attempting to embarrass me in front of my girlfriend.  This turd needed to be flushed down the drain.

She is non-ambulatory, non-verbal, has autistic-like sensitivities, and often will require one or more diaper changes on a long flight.  Consequently, we always sit as close to the back of the plane as possible, as she is much too large to change in the tiny bathroom, and past flight crews have been very accommodating in arranging to either block off the aisle, screen off the last row of seats, or allow us to use the floor of the galley when everything is locked down After service.  \\n\\nWe were explaining this to the flight crew and Ms Owens when she took it upon herself to insist that that absolutely could not be done, that we were only allowed to change Camille in the bathroom, which is physically impossible, and to aggressively verbally berate my wife Christina over wanting to make some arrangement so that we could get to our destination with a minimum of discomfort and inconvenience to ourselves and our fellow passengers.  \\n\\nHer aggression set off our daughter into a loud and prolonged screaming fit.  Rather than wait for the meltdown to pass, or to back off and give us a chance to calm our daughter, Ms Owens immediately contacted security to have us removed from the plane, which was unnecessary, humiliating, and a tremendous inconvenience.  \\n\\nThe security manager, Mike, was extremely kind, courteous and helpful as he assisted us from the plane, and consequently rebooked our flights for tomorrow, and set us up at a hotel near the airport.

We are also stuck in a hotel without most of our luggage and some of our prescriptions.

I really think that the salad could do without the parsley and would probably taste a lot better with cilantro, but that may just be my bias love of cilantro :P. Since the flavor wasn't doing much for me I got some of the hot sauce they had and mixed it in with the salad and after that then it actually tasted a lot better. Even after the hot sauce I wasn't able to finish the salad so I brought it home to eat later. Usually I don't think it's a good idea to bring home salad because it usually gets all soggy and gross, but for some reason this salad was oh kay when I ate it later that night.

I usually run into an issue where the seolleongtang broth is too watery and it's mostly bone, but this broth was thick and there was plenty of meat.  They make fresh kimchi and their arlbap had plenty of fish eggs and veggies.",

Apparently he had just been sat and was outraged. While walking by he told us he'd be right with us. We were a little relieved when someone else came to our table and introduced herself as our server. Since 3/5 of us have been servers in the past, we felt bad for her for getting us dumped on her and understood what it's like to work with a jerk like our original server (who spent the rest of the night working at a leisurely pace) to the point that we all agreed to pitch in extra for the tip to leave her something that would hopefully make her night a little better and enough to make the original guy feel like an idiot. But, the rare moments she spent at our table were never friendly and mostly awkward and uncomfortable. She completely forgot about drink orders and we were very clearly an inconvenience to her. Icing on the cake of awkwardness was watching and listening to her yell at her manager at the end of the meal. We were about to ask for the check when she was getting sat again and lost it because she already had FOUR TABLES.

I've been to this store COUNTLESS times between my own wedding, and several other weddings I have been a part of.  Most recently, I am the Matron of Honor in a friends wedding and we purchased the bridesmaid dress here. \\n\\nFirst off, when choosing the size for my dress, the girls measured me and told me to order a size six.  I am a small girl (or at least I like to think so), the previous wedding I was in, my dress size was a two - and I haven't gained weight.  Now, I could have ordered a different size, but the girls scared me so much I just ordered the six... fast forward several months later when I pick up the dress.

Considering I don't usually get these kind of alterations I decide to get it done at the store because I figured they were the experts - WRONG choice.\\n\\nI make an appointment, which is hard to do on the limited schedule the alterations lady works.  I settle on a Friday in the middle of the day, causing me to have to leave work early.  Turns out the lady shows up 20 minutes late.

Then, the lady says she can come back in an hour to fix it... I go home - 20 minutes later she is there and I have to rush back to the store to get the dress fixed.  There is more to the story, but I won't bore you.\\n\\nAt the end of the day, the store owner offered me $35 dollars for my troubles... that's right $35 off of the $145 I paid for alterations--- BTW the dress cost me $120, so the alterations because I was convinced to order the wrong size cost more than the dress itself.  SO ANNOYED.\\n\\nI WON'T be back to this store.  I've bought so much here and now realize the lack of service is not worth my convince.

The male manager came toward the front desk and said \\\"Ladies, how are you doing?\\\"  Both of us said \\\"Great, thanks\\\" only to find he was looking at the girls who had walked in behind us wearing skimpy dresses.  He completely ignored us despite the fact that we were right in front of him and talked directly to him.  So rude.  Our waitress came to take our order wearing Victoria's Secret yoga pants.  Really?  I ordered water to drink because I'm not a beer fan.  The water tasted like sewer water.  It was revolting.  It was 110 degrees and muggy outside so for me to choose dehydration over that water, it was truly foul.\\n\\nBoth my friend and I decided to order burgers (the menu has a VERY limited selection).

She said on event days it's too busy for them to be able to cook anything in any different way.  There were 4 tables in the entire restaurant with patrons sitting at them.  Even the tables in the bar were empty.  So having 4 tables means they're too busy to make food the way a customer wants it.  That is flat out ridiculous.  I will not eat meat that is undercooked so I decided to order the philly cheesesteak sandwich instead after being assured the meat in that sandwich is actually cooked.\\n\\nOur food arrived... my friend's food arrived with no side of ranch and no side of mayo.

The service was ok, never great, but never bad. So we kept returning. On a saturday morning I called in to get my dog seen as he was showing some alarming signs he was very sick. Warner Vista was not able to accommodate the request and suggested i go to an emergency animal hospital or wait til Monday. I then called Caring Hearts Animal Clinic, from a friends recommendation, and they made space for him that day. He tested positive for Parvo even though he had been vaccinated at Warner Vista. Caring Hearts treated him that day outpatient as inpatient was very expensive. Caring Hearts also suggested that i get in contact with Warner Vista so they could call the vaccine manufacturer as the Manufacturers have guarantees and will cover the costs if our dog meets the criteria. Warner Vista was closed til Monday. Sunday Caring Hearts opened 730 am for our dog's outpatient treatment even though they were closed. They opened before opening hrs on Monday for the same thing. At 8am monday i called Warner Vista explaining my dog has parvo, he was vaccinated there and i need them to call the manufacturer to see if they would cover the expenses. The lady said Denise is out of the office and she does that. I inquired if there is anyone else at the office that could call and inquire and she said no. Tuesday morning Caring Hearts opened before hours again! for outpatient treatment. 8am tuesday i call in again to Warner Vista to make sure Denise contacts the manufacturer. The lady said Denise doesn't come in til 2pm and she will call me right away. I did not hear from Warner Vista again til a week later. I called Caring Hearts right after this on the tuesday and they were in shock. They went ahead and got in contact with the manufacturer, even though they have no relationship with them and use a different brand vaccine, and within 2 hrs they and agreed to cover the expenses. Tuesday at lunch i took my dogs in for inpatient treatment at caring hearts. By the next Monday at 4 pm (7 days later)! i got a call from Denise at Warner Vista asking for information to contact Merial the vaccine manufacturer. I hung up in shock. We had said goodbye to our dog the night before because it did not look like he would make it. Fortunately, he did, he didn't eat or drink for 12 whole days and by wednesday, after 13 days of being sick, 12 days of treatment (9 inpatient) he came home. I know that without that inpatient treatment he would be dead, and we would not have been able to provide that, not knowing the costs would be covered. \\n\\nMy dog would have been dead if i had waited for Warner Vista, Caring Hearts Animal Clinic not only saved my dog, they took the initiative when Warner Vista failed miserably, and also told us that when and if we reach the $5000 limit the vaccine manufacturer will cover, they (Caring Hearts) will cover any costs after the $5000. \\n\\nI really hope you read this and do not take your dog to Warner Vista.

The seats were like large boxes without backs. There wasn't anyone sitting behind us but can imagine that some might be uncomfortable with that when it's busy...your back would be literally against the back of the person sitting behind you. I'm a social person so think that it has potential and is an interesting way to provide seating. \\n\\nThe sushi wasn't bad....but wasn't anything to write home about either. It was a bit more expensive than it should have been. An iced tea, edemame, eel roll, and 1 piece maguro/ 1piece ebi ran me 18 bucks. I really wouldn't have minded if the service was good or if it was exceptional in the form of food presentation. Everything was mediocre at best. \\n\\nThe people I was with ordered from the lunch menu. They seemed to be quite happy with the quality and quantity of food. They each spent about 8 bucks. The egg drop soup was kind of bland according to one. \\n\\nWe all agreed on the service though. We had to ask for things multiple times, we were left alone with empty glasses, when our food came we were pretty much left alone, and we ended up sitting around for 10 minutes after we finished eating (staring at the waitress trying to get her to come over) before we had to go and ask for the check from the guy at the register. Our waitress was sitting at a table eating. Again, there were only 3 tables occupied and it was when they first opened. There is no excuse for the horrible service. I'm pretty understanding when it comes to justified bad service - I used to be a waiter. I understand that when things are crazy and chaotic, that service can suffer...and understandably. However, there is no excuse for how we were treated...or not treated as the case may be. I wont be going back to this place. If I do, it will be for carry out.

The clerk brushed off my complaint and said \\\"Well bring it on by and we will fit you in.\\\" I give in and drive down there. The guys working there were nice and professional. They took my truck and told me it would be around an hour and a half. The place was swamped. They call me 45 minutes later and tell me my truck is ready. I was pleasantly surprised. I picked up my truck and paid thirty bucks. I open my hood and checked my fluids. They didn't top off my windshield washer fluid, my radiator reservoir, or check my tire pressure. Every other place does includes these services. I checked my oil and it was clean. One point for them. So I begrudgingly go to the auto parts store and buy the fluids I need and a tire pressure gauge. While checking my tire pressure I notice one of my tires has a leaky tire valve stem. And it is leaking air like crazy! I call Firestone back and the manager Craig answers. I tell him I was just there for an oil change and I would like a leaky stem replaced. He told me to come down and he would have it fixed. I show up and Craig was very helpful. He asked which technician worked on my truck. I told him I don't know. He tells me they won't be in trouble (But I could tell they would be haha). He looks up who worked on my truck on the computer and runs to the back of the shop. I then see a technician running to get my truck and driving it to the shop to fix my stem. After ten minutes my truck is parked right in front of the front door (VIP service). Manager Craig tells me there will be no charge for fixing the valve stem. He tells me that if his technicians were doing their jobs, they would have noticed the broken valve stem and could have fixed it right then and there. Thus, eliminating me having to drive back and forth. I thanked Craig and left. Will I go back for a half assed oil change? Probably not.

The idea is nice but I am not sure about trekking down those stairs after a couple of beers. As for service; I was not really satisfied. Maybe it was because the waitress never came back to take our food order.

While not quite as bad as you would expect, it's still the standard grease-laden goodies that just seem to go great with beer.\\n\\nThe one detriment to this place for me was that they allow smoking inside.

The saving grace is that there is a great patio outside where you can go if cancer isn't your thing.\\n\\nOne final personal note: if you come here and order Bud Light (or some other equivalent) you're wasting space and need to be eradicated.",

(4) service - a little sluggish but it's a pub (3), value: $11 for the steak and mushroom pie with the fixin's and $15 for a healthy portion of fish and chips (4).\\n\\nA big shout out to the Yelpers - they were on the money with this place.\\n\\nThere are alot of things to love about this pub - first is the ambience. From the dark wooden panels on the wall to the true Irish transplants serving you, it give this establishment a feel of authenticity. The video poker area is well cordoned off from the pub and hence relatively smoke free.\\n\\nWe ordered a plate of their fish and chips and an Irish steak and mushroom pie (which takes 20 minutes but is worth the wait, my friends). While we were waiting, a neighbouring table were served their orders of fish. The reassuring crunch as they dug in signalled that McMullans ain't messing around when it comes to their food.\\n\\nWhen our fish and chips arrived, we were surprised at the substantial portion (perhaps we would order the appy sized portion next time). Three large fillets perched on top of a mountain of fries with some coleslaw and tartar sauce. Perfect. The plate was also free of grease which was another good sign.\\n\\nThe fish was in a beer-battered style and had a perfect ratio of batter to fillet. The batter was light, crispy and held up well despite all the dunking into various sauces. Best of all - it wasn't oily. The chips were mid-sized cut and crispy. Overall, they held their texture pretty well with the passage of time. The coleslaw was pretty standard fare. The tartar sauce, though, needed a little tartness and sweetness but was okay.\\n\\nThe steak and mushroom pie was a wonder. The flaky dome arrived at the table accompanied by a mound of mashed potatoes and buttered peas. The filling was a satisfying combination of beef and mushrooms, stewed with some kind of flavourful ?beer. \\n\\nThe most amazing thing was the pastry. At first we thought the pie was in a ramikin but it was completely freestanding - that really speaks to the robustness of the crust. The pastry was flaky and crisp all the way around (including the bottom which normally tends to get soggy). McMullens has truly perfected the art of the Irish pie. The mashed potatoes were solid - had a nice flavour and a great gravy but could have used a little more texture. The buttered peas were good.\\n\\nOverall, with these pub favourites done so well plus some rather interesting Irish beer and whiskey flights at affordable prices, this is the place to go for some Irish comfort.",

The food is still good and though it has long since been eclipsed in variety and quality by others across the Strip, what struck me today was how few of the staff bother to smile at the guests, and none more so than the staff tending the actual buffets. Indeed one whose name I noted was Bernard (an elderly chinese or other asian) was irritated that I had asked for a slice of prime rib as he was busy filling a bowl of horse radish. He made me wait until he was finished and then quickly sliced a dry piece which he flung on to my plate. Another staffer (an african american man, late forties/fifties, didn't catch his name) looking after the breakfasty items (this was their midweek brunch service) ignored a question I had and disappeared off inside. Sure the rest of the reviewers are right here - there was no line and the food was solid. But the key to hospitality is not just about product, but more importantly about making people feel at home. The Mirage has lost that quality from 20 years ago when it was fully staffed by professionals who remembered the golden era of Vegas and had been chosen by leadership because of their interpersonal skills. I question if Mirage leadership, certainly at the buffet restaurant, is being as critical now. Remember, this isn't a cheap meal at $23-24 and the Mirage is still deemed a four star brand. Not sure if Mirage leadership look at reviews like this but the staffer details are included for them - for the rest of the readership, I do suggest that there could be several reasons why some buffets have long lines and the Mirage has no line.",

However, as with most of the other Yelpers, I have to agree that the service is lackluster at best. \\n\\nAs for the food, I really enjoy their Turkey BLT sandwich and their cheese fries- soo good! And by the way- they have buy one get one free regular sized sandwiches after 4PM on Tuesdays, meaning that two sandwiches, two drinks, and two bags of chips are only around $10. Slammin' deal. \\n\\nHowever, each and every single time my boyfriend and I come here there is ALWAYS an issue with the service. \\n\\nFor example, one Tuesday we came here and ordered the BOGO sandwiches. Mine was the Turkey BLT with everything on it and his was the Turkey BLT minus the lettuce and tomato. We waited nearly 50 minutes to get our food which was absolutely outrageous considering that there were maybe 4 other occupied tables in the restaurant. Not to mention when the food came out, my boyfriend's sandwich had lettuce scraps on it (the lettuce is shredded). No, they didn't put lettuce on by mistake and leave it there, they put it on the sandwich, must have realized that it was incorrect and then haphazardly picked it off. This is what really bothered me. If you make something incorrectly, make it again. For all they know, he could have had an allergy to the lettuce (which he doesn't, but still the same principle applies) and he could have gone into anaphylactic shock. Not cool. Whatsoever. But since he's not allergic to lettuce, he just spent a good five minutes picking the remnants away. \\n\\nAnother Tuesday we came here, and it was a night where the Flyers (Philadelphia's NHL team) were playing in the first round of the playoffs. The place was at about 1/4 capacity. Being a Philadelphia-oriented restaurant, we were shocked to see telenovelas playing on TV. So, after we ordered, I got back in line and waited my turn to get to the front counter. Once I got there, I politely asked the guy working there if when he had a chance if he could turn on the Flyers game. He looked me dead in the face and said \\\"Yeeeeeah, that's probably not going to happen...\\\" Shocked, I said ok and walked back to our booth. One of the patrons behind me must have said something to the guy because he walked over to our table and mentioned something about how he told him what channel the game was on. So rude and belittling. Not to mention we waited another 30 minutes for our food. \\n\\nThe third time we came here, my boyfriend ordered cheese fries to go and THAT'S IT! He waited 25 minutes for french fries and a cup of cheese wiz. Really? And not to mention, they must have sat the to-go bag down on a wet counter because as we were carrying the fries into our house from the car, the soaked bottom of the bag tore and our fries ended up on the floor. Really not cool. At all. \\n\\nOverall the service sucks, but the food is good. Oh, and just a tip for you guys, if you feel like you're going to want Corleone's for lunch, order it at 9:30 AM for it to be ready on time.",

I love the fact that it's literally across the street from us and we can walk there and back.  The bartenders that work at nights are very sweet.  (We've only been there during the day time to order food, so we haven't met the morning shift bartenders, but I wouldn't be surprised if they were just as nice.)  They do take drink AND food orders.  They actually always offer a food menu or ask if you're hungry.  AND they check up on you to make sure the Food is up to par after the food has arrived.\\n\\nMost of their food is healthy and all their foods have tons of spice.  One of my favorite dishes is the Wet Burrito. I always get that with cajun/blackened chicken and I ask for them to do half red and half green sauce on top--it makes it look pretty too ;)  Their Fish Taco is a must have.  They're healthy so they won't have the McDonald's or KFC grease taste, which I know can be delicious if you like the unhealthy flavors... I can't hate cuz I crave those too time to time!  They can seem to be a bit dry, but they have the sauces to drizzle of the tacos.  The Wahoo's Fries, which is obviously not so healthy, are a must have too.  I wish other places would make their nacho's the way Wahoo's make their fries; it's totally loaded!  You can always ask for their green cilantro sauce with any of your dishes... yummmm!  \\n\\nThat reminds me, one time, one of the bartenders put the green cilantro sauce along the walls of the cup and poured in the drink so every sip of bloody mary had a hint of cilantro.  It was DELICIOUS!  That's another must have if you like bloody mary and cilantro!\\n\\nAnyways, you gotta go and experience Wahoo's.

In the meantime, I was starving like crazy and quite annoyed that each time I finished one roll, I still sat there waiting for my next, and next.  I was pretty disappointed by the rolls too (can't remember which I ordered) but their saving grace was the Volcano roll which came last.  \\n\\nThis volcano roll has had me come back 3 more times (only take out, because I didn't feel like dealing with their service again).  The first time I took out, I ordered two volcano rolls.  They were thrown together, all meshed up, never mind the presentation.  Sushi is all about presentation.  Oh well, it tasted great anyway. \\n\\nThe second take out, my husband and I ordered the same volcano roll x 2.  My husband wasn't so blown away and said, \\\"That was not worth $25.00\\\" (Have I mentioned that the roll is some $11.00??  I can go to a fancy sushi restaurant for that kind of price).  The rolls were sort of dry and thrown together with holes inside.  I chalked it up to them not caring about their take outs.  We agreed, we wouldn't come back \\n\\nFF to tonight.  I was starving for sushi and I didn't want to deal with walking into the W in my PJ's, soooo.. I re-yelped Dozo and let all of these positive reviews sway me.  I ordered a volcano (Shrimp tempura with spicy tuna) and a red dragon (crab with spicy tuna).  Horrible.  \\nAgain, holes inside the sushi, and you would laugh if you saw how much shrimp was inside the sushi.  Instead, they filled with a ton of hard, dry, tempura (the breadcrumbs).  The spicy tuna wasn't spicy at all.  \\nThe crab (a $12.00 roll) was so dry and fried that the meat had turned brown.  It's like they pre-fried and then threw it in the microwave.  Many of the pieces would fall apart as soon as you tried to pick it up, it's so dry.  The only thing they got right this time : the presentation.

With the water running through the middle of it all and the clock centre-piece overlooking the bridge, Stockbridge reminds me of small town nightlife - such as Dunfermline or Stirling - only without the variety and population. So when people recommend the area for a social, my vivid imagination immediately creates images of overcrowded bars, long lines at the bar and extensive waits for those impulsive cats that don't book tables in advance...!\\n\\nHaving said that, I found Hamilton's to be a bar I could frequent quite often.

Turned out even that little squeeze wasn't that little anyway. Perfectly fine. The waitress' standards were obviously higher than ours!\\n\\nAnyway a fine start to Hamilton's, which all in all didn't disappoint going forward from there.

However the company was golden and the food was worth the wait, which was barely noticed.\\n\\nI went for the Crispy Pork Belly with Stornoway Black Pudding, braised rhubarb, caramelised apple and watercress salad. I'm starting to feel like a Pork Belly connoisseur these days but, with those accompaniments it was too hard to resist, the only competition coming from the Duck dish on an otherwise standard-looking menu.

I can imagine a visit here more enjoyable if you can secure a seat and/or table. Or 'sore thumb' be thy name.\\n\\n-- Potential to be a bit cliquey.

Generally quite trendy and lively. Looks like a mix of locals, students and office after-party folk. Good.\\n\\nAll in all a vibrant atmosphere, good friendly service and a couple of smart dishes have piqued my interest. I'll return at least one more time.

Upon opening my box, I noticed it was only half full. It had grilled chicken on top and some sauce covering the chicken. I was very unimpressed with the portion size for a $10 meal at a take out joint. The sauce was only okay but there was not enough of it to go around. The chicken was good but not anything more. The naan tasted like a spongy piece of blah. My wife's meal had a TON of noodles and very little shrimp. The shrimp were quite tiny and very rubbery.   \\n\\nSince we got our meals for take out, I decided to call and speak to a manager to inquire about our concerns. The manager tried to tell me that they fill the boxes and the food settles about 1/3 of the way down the box. That's a lot of air in the food!  The manager did not seem to care much about our concerns. No sorry, or please give us another try. She only said she would pass the word along????  I'm not sure what that means, but okay!

So we order a salad but despite sounding delicious, it did not taste very good at all, it was such a let down. And then to make it even better it started raining and they had to rush us all inside and because they didn't have enough tables we had to eat the rest of the meal at the bar.

There was just no way that I could have brought the car back in its sandy state.\\n\\nBut to their credit, the car looked great all said and done.\\n\\nIt took about three full washings, but they got it looking back to its original state.  And really, I couldn't have asked for anything more.  I wasn't thrilled about the high price I had to pay for the wash, but honestly, they put a lot of work into it, so it was worth it.\\n\\nTheir lobby is actually decent, filled with arcade games and snack machines.  Nice touch.  They aren't a fan of credit cards, but they weren't difficult about it, and worked with me regardless.\\n\\nHopefully, I'll never have to return a car for them to wash in that dirty a state, but at least I know they are thorough about their work.  The price then saved me a LOT of grief with the rental place later, so I am grateful for that.\\n\\nRecommended.",

Customers are not a burden, but the core of your job. You hold in your hands the power to keep customers coming back, perhaps even to make or break the company.  Being on par in terms of price and quality only gets you into the game. Service wins the game. It starts with respect.

Or at least, the people who frequent it.\\n\\nThe outside aesthetic of the hotel makes little sense and has no continuity with the inside of the hotel (which at least is nicer). The first thing you notice upon walking in is an over-powering scent of roses, a very large lobby with no place to sit and a near-deafening noise of casino games and crowds to your left as you try to check in.\\n\\nTRY to check in - that's my point to make here. My sister and I arrived at around 2:30pm, the rooms we reserved were booked via our Mother who was flying in later that evening with my Dad to meet us for our weekend Birthday vacation.\\n\\nWe all share the same last name, all our names were booked for the reservations - and the INCREDIBLY RUDE woman behind the desk refused to let us check in!!\\n\\nWhen asked why, she explained it was a hotel policy the cardholder who paid for the rooms be present at check in. As frequent travelers, we've NEVER heard of such a ridiculous \\\"security measure\\\" - especially since she had our names listed, and we had I.D.s\\n\\nAs it turns out, our parents flights were delayed and the baggage check-in fee was ridiculously high (not to mention we didn't trust our bags to strangers handling thousands of bags a day - an easy mixup or theft and our trip would be ruined!)\\n\\nSo with no place to sit, and the refusal to be flexible (mind you, rooms are usually good to check in after 12pm at any other place in the world) - our room, which had the first night PRE-PAID, sat empty... while my Sister and I had to KILL NINE HOURS lugging our bags for a place to sit that wasn't in front of a slot machine where we'd be losing our lungs to horrible cigars.\\n\\nWe assumed Vegas would be more competitively priced regarding food, thinking a sit-down meal or two would kill time... such was not the case. The prices of places to eat are higher than ever. The nearest \\\"affordable\\\" place we found was a SUBWAY shop. In Vegas terms, the cost of your predictable run-of-the-mill fast food was twice as much as you'd normally pay anywhere outside of NYC.\\n\\nSo now we're tired, hungry, and have 8 hours to go.\\n\\nGetting back to the MGM - this is where we really lost our marbles. Turns out, there's a place within the casino by the pools called 'Television City' - You sign up to be part of a focus group and are PAID to watch horrible TV Pilot episodes, rate them and in less than an hour, it's an easy 20.00 plus some pretty good coupons for the over-priced Starbucks and Hagaan Daz nearby.\\n\\nSure you lose some brain cells watching mindless TV, but you have a place to sit, you get paid, you get discounts at other shops in the casino - and for us, it would have been a great time-killer as we waited for our Parents all day. \\n\\nBut did the lady behind the check-in desk apologetically mention this to us? Not at all. Nope. We didn't discover it until the next day. When our parents arrived, it was well after midnight before we really checked-in and yes, MGM still charged us for the whole night with no apology. They have a strict policy against Customer satisfaction. No wonder the company is going under and owes a ton of money to Dubai World Properties.\\n\\nThe hotel rooms have NO AIR. You can blast that thermostat all you want but the room will not get any cooler. You can crack open a window too but that's all they allow you to do... is crack it. The windows do not open. It's not a jam, it's seriously how they're designed. You can only open a quarter centimeter contraption on the windowsill for fresh air. Our view was of the airport. Whatever.\\n\\nThe next day we decided to look for the pool. That was one thing we were looking forward to the most - it was a vacation, so let's relax by the pool and catch some sun yes? \\n\\nNO.\\n\\nThe distance from the hotel room, to the elevators, to the casino floor, to the pool line (yes, you wait in a turnstyle line to get to the pools) is ridiculous. Not to mention, you have to parade THROUGH the casino, past the nice restaurants that only have views of the hallway... in your swimsuit??? Hell no!\\n\\nLuckily, we have the sense to not gross out other guests with our non-super model bodies in swimwear... but that common courtesy is not mutual. Almost every girl at the MGM Grand dresses like a trashy hooker minus the trashy hooker body. The best word to describe some of the more.. \\\"rednecked\\\" guests would be... Trailor Trash Spring Break.\\n\\nFinally arriving at the pool(s), we realized that our hotel was the Wal-Mart of Las Vegas hotels. The more beautiful pools were closed off, and two were open and CROWDED. The hours were 9-8pm or something ridiculous and there was no room to swim. Not to mention they were blasting the most horrible college-rock.\\n\\nDrunk girls throwing up in the water, Frat Boys acting like animals, children pee'ing in the pool, old people in bikinis...total nightmare.\\n\\nCirque Du Soleil's 'Ka' was AMAZING.",

Anyway, service at check in took about 20 minutes, but definitely felt like a lot longer than that because of the long line that was building up. Not only was the service slow, but also unwelcoming. Finding the room was a bit confusing because the hotel is split between two buildings. If we hadn't asked them how to get there they probably wouldn't have told us themselves. Even after all of that we were still somewhat happy with the hotel because it was such a good deal. First night went by without a hitch. Or so we thought. The next morning my brother complained that he had felt itchy as evidenced by a few bites on his forearms and his leg. We were worried, but eventually shrugged it off thinking that it could have been some skin allergic reaction. The next morning, my other brother had said that he had gotten some bites, too. He also said he remembered killing what he thought was a bug. After showing us the bug he had killed, we were convinced of our suspicion. BED BUGS!! We looked around the bed, on the headboard, and under the sheets and sure enough we easily found 5 bed bugs. We took pictures and took video of the incident. Upon check out, we had told them of the incident. We asked for the manager and we were told that because it was the weekend, there was no manager on duty and that he'd be in on Tuesday (it was a Sunday when we checked out).

I was on restaurant side to listen to Simplified. Set up is nice, plenty of parking, I would go back if Simplified were playing, but not otherwise. My two recommendations are: 1. The bar service is VERY slow. The young one guy is friendly, but 3 different times, I stood at the almost empty bar and waited 3-5 minutes for another beer. Those three times, one bartender was looking up watching TV and never acknowledged me and the other bartenders were visiting with each other! No bar staff should ever make a customer wait for another drink because they are watching TV or chatting with each other! Especially when the bar had maybe 3-4 people sitting at it! Two of those times, I had to physically walk over to where those bartenders were visiting (to make it obvious) to get my beer? 2. I know is early but the food really wasn't good. Not even for bar food. Sorry, I wish this review was better, but it's just honest. I would only go back if Simplified was playing, but I wouldn't get food!

However,  I'm sure that establishments like this have a high turnover rate with employees,  so the service and food quality may vary widely over a range of time.

The ice cream is creamy, it's light, it's fluffy, it's addicting and it's really just everything you think about in an ice cream. The other reviews explain the ice cream to the core, so I won't go too into detail about the flavors, but I will say that my two favorites for now are the chocolate brownie and of course, the salted Carmel. Put them together and it's definitely 'ice cream-you-scream-we-all-scream-for-Sweet Republic-ice cream-sweetness.'\\n\\nHere's another special treat to Sweet Republic. Their heavenly toffee! It could be the best toffee I've ever had. In fact, I think I'm going to deem it the best toffee I've had to-date. The almond toffee is buttery, crunchy and soft all together. I put it on top of my salted Carmel ice cream, forgot about every calorie I was consuming and enjoyed sweet moments of Sweet Republic bliss. The bacon brittle intrigued me and I must say, I wasn't too eager to try it. But, after reading about it so often, I had to give it a whirl and was happily surprised! The bacon taste definitely overtakes the taste of the toffee making it taste like you are eating bacon with an infused taste of left-over syrup from your pancakes. Actually, I bet it would taste pretty good on top of waffles or pancakes! \\n\\nSo with that, I will end the 241st review of Sweet Republic. This is a friendly, fresh and delicious business located so randomly in the middle of a mini shopping complex off of Shea and I'm so proud that this local Scottsdale business has gotten so much recognition.

My bf joked that he would try another piece to see if there was more plastic & he had the same type of texture to his piece. The waiter took it back & told us he would make another one & then proceeded to tell us that it wasn't plastic, but just that the skin of the onion wasn't cut off prior to making it. So they made us another one & I don't know if it was because I was already grossed out by the one before, or if they were off their game that night, but it didn't taste right either.  It was such a disappointment considering that's almost my favorite part of the whole place!\\n\\nSo onto entrees...\\n\\nI ordered a steak & sides & my bf ordered his steak medium rare.

He was very nice & said he would take it back & put it into the grill for a little bit longer... I agreed that it just needed a tiny but as I wanted mine medium, but not bloody whatsoever. The manager comes back with my steak & is very apologetic & asks if it's up to standards. Just looking at the steak you could tell that the top had this hard layer over it as if it was burnt. I told him it was fine & he assured me he would make me another one, but at that point my bf had gotten his food & I didn't want to wait even longer for mine to get done as we had other birthday plans... So I cut into mine and it was just okay...not anything great as my previous steaks had been. I even had to cut off the charred part because it was like eating a burnt steak. Ugh. The manager was VERY nice, but at that point I just felt like nothing they did that night (food wise) was right & I was regretting even coming there for my birthday dinner. My BF (who is the King of loving his meat medium rare) had to send his back because he had to run to the bathroom to spit out a piece that he couldn't chew through! He got his steak back & it was overcooked as well... My steak was taken care of by the manager but the horrible bloomin onion wasn't & we were offered dessert, (not \\\"birthday dessert) but declined because I wasn't going to give them the chance to ruin that for me too.\\n\\nOverall, we will definitely not be back to this location again!

The food is a little bit salty, but when you are way wasted (which I was at the time), salt is good.  It is typical Asian fusion with your obligatory sushi rolls.  I had some grilled sea bass and a sushi roll which was decent.  Besides, ordering dinner here was a decent and quick way to get full and get into the club.\\n\\nPart 2 Review: Club\\n\\nAs I mentioned above, I have been to Tao a lot of times.  It all kind of blends together, from raiding a bachelorette, to meeting Jesus and the Apostles hanging out with the 300 Spartans (it was one of the Halloweens I was at.... or maybe bits and pieces of two different Halloweens???), to being hungover as soon as I walked in at 11:00pm because I drank all day and then stopped for a couple hours.... you get the picture.  I have had a lot of fun fun times at Tao and it is definitely a go to place for me.

We were greeted by the Hostess Chelsea who seemed to know just who we were even though this was our first experience at Todd's. \\n\\nAlthough small, the restaurant was well set up, clean, and conducive to a fine dining experience. Once we were settled at our table our Server, Terry was there to get us beverages and chat.

My \\\"Grumpy's\\\" salad was a classic wedge of lettuce salad with a twist. The lettuce was shredded; there was some diced tomato, and a little onion all mixed together with wonderful blue cheese crumbs. This was piled high on an icy cold plate. Our Server Terry used a big wooden grinder to insure I had enough fresh cracked pepper to satisfy me.\\n\\nAfter we lazed over our first course Terry and Laura (hope I got this right) presented us with our main courses. We dove in to this repast first tasting our own plates and then on to each other's. The best thing to say is everything was a palate delight. Libby's medallions of beef were cooked perfectly and so tender that you could by pass chewing and just roll your tongue to bring out the outstanding texture and flavor. My roasted pork (huge) was grilled to perfection, juicy and wound through a myriad of flavors that questioned every taste bud in my mouth. I am still astounded by the mixtures of tastes that one bite could bring bouncing through my mouth. Glorious vegetables that were lightly cooked using different methods to produce texture and flavor explosions adorned our plates. I truly enjoyed the red cabbage with its crunchy and unusual components kept me excited for more. Libby ate her baby carrot and mine too. She also had a homemade and hot potato chip that was crunchy and pleasingly warm. My wonderful wife ate her own baked tomato and the speared mine right off my plate. At least she smiled at me as she finished the little beauty while I pined my existence. There were other veggies but I am just leaving them alone. They were texturally and flavor right. They got eaten too.\\n\\nNow, let's talk desert. The Hazelnut Cr\\u00e8me Br\\u00fbl\\u00e9e was thick and rich with a whipped cream atop. An enticing blue berry and raspberry insured that the looker put a spoon to it. My Salted Butterscotch Pudding was absolutely worth going in to battle to get again. Nestled into a clear glass was a scoop of dangerously tan and creamy butterscotch pudding. Around this ball of fun was a thick almost honey like caramel syrup and a dab of cream fluff that accented the whole artistry. With my first spoonful I ensured that I had pudding, caramel, and topping. The whole thing caught me off guard. I had forgotten the salt. Pudding and cream mix enveloped my every taste bud and as this mixture began to disintegrate I was hit by the salty and sweet aftermath like I had just taken a low right to the jaw. I have never tasted anything like this. It was an amazing creation. I hope I can get it as an entr\\u00e9e sometime.\\n\\nThat's it. Go to Todd's Unique. Feel well cared for and well fed.

Their truck had one of the longest lines today (Food Truck Friday @ Phx Public Market), and since I wasn't feeling adventurous enough to try Cajun, I went for the dogs.\\n\\nThe Igby dog I gleefully munched was spot on - the acidity and fresh crunch of the coleslaw balanced well with the richness of the blue cheese and the sweet tang of the BBQ sauce.   It was just messy enough to be satisfying without making you look like a sloppy fool while milling around the lot.  And chasing it with local prickly pear soda = heaven.  It was a satisfying meal and not too expensive for the quality delivered.\\n\\nTheir menu is well-rounded, always important for a food truck since the menu needs to be small.  With five combinations of toppings, all with wildly differing flavor profiles, six choices of dog, plus the build-your-own option, there is something for everyone.  Their meat dogs are from Schreiner's, so you're golden with any choice you make there, and there is a veg option, as well, which I will never, ever be commenting on.  They also have a special of the day dog, which you'll have to arrive early for, since the devotees generally gobble them up.  And more power to them - the special I saw on the board looked amazing, and I was sorry I had missed it, having arrived an hour and a half into service.\\n\\nThe only reason I am daring to knock a star off this rating is that there is one tiny thing that needles me: the bread they use.  Don't get me wrong, the flatbread is delicious, inventive, and conducive to a not-too-messy eating experience.  It's a crucial part of their style of hot dog, and Short Leash's followers are nuts about it.  But...for me, I felt that they have a slight packaged quality to them that reminds me of Trader Joe's, which is not a horrible by any means, but it leaves me craving something more....  I can't help but wish they would add just one more option of bread/bun - in my opinion, a pretzel bun would make a killer addition.\\n\\nShort Leash Dogs is a gem in the food truck scene and is absolutely not to be missed by local foodies.

I was torn between some sort of a flat iron steak (which is more than I normally do on a weeknight) or the highlighted specialty beef sandwich.  She told me that the beef was on some sort of a salty pretzel roll.  She almost made it seem like that was the drawback but that the beef was awesome.

Once again, she knew I was laying low on the carbs because I told her in order to solicit her input.  \\n\\nWell this thing comes out open faced.  The bun was something.  It was probably far too salty for the average Joe but you could always brush some of the sea salt off.  But when I tell you that the amount meat on this open faced presentation was less than you would find on a $1.29 Arbys junior, I am not kidding.  Half of the bottom bun was even showing.  I could tell that when she set it down it was probably the first time she'd seen our order because she sort of looked like she was a little ashamed.

Are you trying to get me shut out of a tip here?\\\"  \\n\\nTruth is it had been a really long day and I didnt need to have the monster specialty sandwich that they seemed to describe in the menu, so I just let it slide.

And I was a frequent tourist to Vegas myself back before I lived here, and so like any good little tourist I had to check out the buffets.\\n\\nBut really, overall, there is just something about the ridiculous opulence and over-the-top decadence of a fancy mega buffet that appeals to me.

If you are willing to pay for convenience, you can skip the line for $15/person, a bargain when everyone is waiting 2+ hours to get in!) and it is a tad pricey but it is worth the cost. There are so many dishes to choose from and just about everything is delicious (with a few exceptions; for example, I would avoid the sushi station). The small individual portions are 1. cute, 2. more hygienic than a big communal pile and 3. allow you to sample more things before feeling too full! It is a little annoying having to juggle all of the tiny plates but I like the concept.\\n\\nThe seafood station is pretty great with piles and piles of crab. They have awesome mac 'n' cheese and the most fantastic little mini burgers that are packed with flavor.

I've noticed some people had complained about the locals discount not being applied but as I was checking in, I was asked for my ID right away to verify my local status (I made sure to emphasize it at the time of booking). As I was walking down the sandstone hallway, I was greeted promptly by the locker room attendant, Karen, who to my surprise was standing right at the door as I was slowly inching to the lockers in awe of the hallway and in full on tourist mode taking pictures.  She gave me a rundown of where things are in the locker room without walking to each and every space (which was fine with me) and shortly presented me with a locker. Spent the rest of my morning into the early afternoon enjoying the spa's amenities! The only downsides were the cool mist room which didn't produce a strong spritz of water and the shower stall I was in because the water didn't drain right away and the bath mat that was in the stall got completely drenched! To me these are minor things in the bigger picture because I enjoyed my massage and stay so much. Will definitely revisit!",

The food quality was excellent, however the experience could be attributed to numerous scenarios such as a new restaurant, kitchen, food runners, or servers all culminating in this less than ideal experience.  I do credit the manager with taking steps to correct the experience only after I had to ask for the manager to visit the table a second time.  Let me explain...\\n\\nLunchtime service there is a zoo.  They're in a great location and they have a good reputation for a quality product.  This was my first visit with a co-worker.  Service took a little longer to visit the table and get our drink order but that's not a major issue for me, since it was busy.  I went with the Zinburger with kobe beef and zucchini fries.  Some of the questions I was getting from the server gave me the impression she was new, and I asked her to confirm that she got the Kobe beef upcharge for my burger.  My dinning buddy ordered a regular burger with truffle fries.\\n\\nThe burgers took some time to get out, most likely due to how busy they were.  As we noticed tables around us getting their burgers we figured we were next.  Then the table that sat and ordered after us got their order and I felt a mistake was made. Then the truffle fries were dropped off at our table, with nothing else. The food runner dropped food off at the wrong table and never confirmed the order with the guests.  That was our order.  Shortly after the server came by and realized the issue I had already discovered.  She apologized for the confusion and the manager came by to apologize for the issue as well.\\n\\nOur order was remade and delivered.  My burger was overcooked but it was still delicious.  The quality of product is very good.  My zucchini fries were seasoned and breaded nicely but I would have preferred them a little more crispy on the batter.  I informed the server that my burger wasn't cooked correctly and showed her and she agreed claiming to inform the manager.  I wasn't about to send this burger back because I was teetering on hangryness.\\n\\nOnce the check came out they comped my burger, which I noticed didn't contain my upcharge for kobe.  So I ate a non-kobe burger after I specifically asked, and checked that it was included?  Additionally, I was not thrilled that they were insulting me by asking us to pay for the other items.  So I had to request the manager again and after I pointed out the lateness of the food and the incorrect burger and it being overcooked she said she would comp the entire meal.  That was the correct course of action in my opinion however I should have never had to request to speak to the manager a second time. We did leave +20% tip in cash and I hope this proves to be a good learning and training experience for them.\\n\\nI think this will be a great spot for burgers but maybe they still need to figure out their logistics. I still want to try that Kobe burger but may need to wait on a day they won't be busy in a lunch rush and they've worked out their kinks.",

We returned to check on our spot and the hostess said she had just called our party. The hostess before did not communicate that they were using phone numbers. (must have been a shift change). Not a big deal by itself. We had good timing and did not lose our spot.\\n\\n2. Server did not introduce himself and was very cold and lacked any personality or genuine concern. While the service was not terrible it was definitely lacking. \\n\\n3. We were going to split 4 burgers. we requested that our burgers be cut in quarters so we could do this easily. The server told us her could bring us steak knives but they wont serve it cut. I asked another server and she said the same thing.\\n\\n4. We decided to do one less burger since we were not able to have the burgers cut to share. We decided it would be too much of a project to try to do at our table with steak knives. Two of the people in our party were going to split a burger and the other two would have there own.\\n\\n5. We asked if it was possible to get the burger that was being shared cut in half. It was a plain Jane burger and I was sure the kitchen could handle this. This resulted in a female staff member who I assume was a manager visiting my table to explain that they did not want to cut the burger because it would change the presentation(the cook wants the presentation his way) and the kitchen is really busy, \\\"so in order to expedite the cooking process they would prefer not to cut the burger\\\". This was a bit of an insult to anyone who has worked in the culinary world not to mention a paying guest.\\n\\n6. The manager took a uncompromising position as I did let her know this. The server hawked over our table the remainder of the visit, most likely to try to regain any lost tip (we still tipped 20%). \\n\\nIn summary, the food was good, but there are plenty of burger joints in the Las Vegas area, many of which I will visit more frequently in place of Bachi Burger. They are pricey as well in comparison to more established burger joints.\\n\\nThe customer service aspect and the arrogant manner in which the manager handled a simple request was what drove down this experience the most.

The guest is paying for a product as well as an experience. Without us, the GUESTS, YOU are out of a job.\\n\\nAdvice to the manager/supervisor: If you want to help the business grow as well as add to your professional success you will have a much easier road granting a special request rather than insulting your patrons intelligence by discussing logistics of a burger kitchen. In the time it took to give your enthusiastic lecture on expediting product from the kitchen, you might have been able to cut 20 or 30 burgers or maybe even grant a simple request to go above and beyond your current set of service standards. Instead we ordered one less burger on this visit, skipped desert and probably wont be back. YOUR JOB IS TO ENSURE GUEST SATISFACTION WHILE CREATING GUEST/BRAND LOYALTY. THE GUEST IS ALWAYS RIGHT.

Seems masochistic if I really believe this venue is two stars right? Well, one does not have a choice if a show is booked here or at another better venue.  \\n\\nThis venue seems to be a magnet for douches. I cannot put it any other way. It's probably the location, because it is not particularly the shows; sets of Steel Panther at Ovation @ Green Valley Ranch go on without a hitch. A Joe Rogan/Deathsquad set goes on without a hitch at the now defunct Playboy Comedy Club at Palms, but here at House of Blues .... ahem ... crowd is comprised of 40% deebags. It could be argued that it is not the venue's fault, but perhaps it is. \\n\\nI have never been hit with a cup full of beer at The Pearl; seems to be something that would only happen at HOB because of several factors:\\n- security is not respected; \\n- security -- generally speaking, is not competent, hence why they are not respected; and\\n- bartenders, some of them at least, are inherently rude pricks therefore agitating the poor cheap beer consumer and filling them with unpleasantness (and cheap nasty libation) which later would inspire them to throw a half-filled cup of the shit towards an innocent group of concert-goers due to the clear lowering of standards of decent etiquette. \\n\\nTen or more times I have walked up to the bar and asked for a cup of ice water. Ten or more times I have scored the HOB employee lottery and gotten a cool bartender that realizes it is exactly fifteen or so seconds of their time. They give me the cup and I give them a couple of Washingtons as compensation. \\n\\nWhy is it that the one time there is a EDM festival outside (at the beach or the arena or who knows [I did not attend], and the aftershow is in the HOB, a deebag bartender, who years earlier as a regular concert-goer probably was the perpetrator of a thrown beer or two at the same venue, announces to my girlfriend that he would not give her water that was from the Las Vegas Valley Water District. Uh, okay. \\n\\nTruly nonsensical, especially considering they use that SAME water for drinks, but perhaps they were mandated with selling more over*priced bottles of water by supervisors/management because they were expecting a bunch of thirsty, candykids to be in there that night. Cool; eight dollars or whatever the hell it is for a bottle of Dasani water, which is just tap water from another city, and no tip for the dude behind the bar.\\n\\nThose other reviews pointing to the gross oversell of the GENERAL ADMISSION/FLOOR areas of HOB-Vegas have it pretty dead on. I have been to, I don't know, ten-twelve different HOB venues and none oversells the GA sections of their concert halls like this HOB does. None have such an impressively poor climate control system either where it seems like it is 120 degrees F during some sets (Common during NBA All-Star Weekend comes to mind).    \\n\\nThis venue will never be a Pearl, or a Book & Stage, but it could be as decently solid as HOBs in other states (Dallas, TX comes to mind, or even Chicago, IL [which is by no means perfect]). There are significant problems that are organic to this particular HOB venue and it is quite sad because a lot of decent shows are booked here. You've been warned. - E\\n\\n*except one time when they were supposed to be the distributor for the LV Weekly advanced screening passes, and they were giving out passes at 11AM, we walked in at 11:01AM, and were informed they were \\\"sold out\\\" of passes.

While on vacation there were a few places my friends and I had heard about quite often and wanted to check out - Pink's was one of them. Located right in our hotel, we figured it'd be one of the better places to eat during our trip, but ... not so much.\\n\\nMaybe it's because I've been spoiled by all the good food here in San Francisco, but Pink's didn't strike me as anything special. Most of the items seemed to be pretty similar, mostly consisting of chili, bacon, onions, cheese, and other meats; not a ton of variety overall. Though I have to say, the portions-to-price ratio was pretty good - you get a gigantic, filling meal for about $10 or so, and unless you have a monstrous appetite you won't need a second hot dog.\\n\\nAs for the food itself? Average. Even though most of my friends and I were feeling ravenous I think only one out of nine of us managed to finish, and it wasn't really because of how filling the hot dogs were. Sure, they're packed to the brim with condiments and other things, but it's mostly standard fare. I actually felt kind of sick and bloated for a few hours afterward, and I certainly didn't feel like finishing the leftovers after looking at it later than day.\\n\\nUnfortunately for people thinking they'll get to sit indoors and have a hot dog in an AC-dominated environment, the only seating is outdoors in the hot, hot Vegas sun, with only a few tables sitting underneath a bit of shade. It's a pretty small location, so if it's crowded you might just want to bring everything back to your room instead. It'll be less messy that way anyway.\\n\\nOverall I don't think Pink's met the hype at all. Perhaps because the original is in Los Angeles and not in Vegas, and in addition I've had better hot dogs at local joints (sorry!). It's probably worth a stop if you're in Vegas, but don't go there expecting the best hot dog you've ever had. You'll only set yourself up for disappointment in the end.",

Flash forward to Sept (give or take) and I called asking where my items were. I was told that there was a computer glitch and my new address wasn't the one being used for mailing. No problem, things happen- they said they would fix it and send over what I needed.\\n\\nFast forward to October, and I still don't have the stuff. I continue to make do with my old stuff, and then remember to call Valley Respiratory and ask what's up. The person there was nice and said that she didn't know why I didn't get my order, it was never shipped- but she would send it out. I never got that shipment either, but with the busy holidays I didn't get a chance to call until Nov/Dec. I again spoke with an employee who said she would mail it out, and also let me know that in Jan I would start receiving my stuff three months worth at a time. I never received anything until the end of Dec, when I got the three months supply that is for Jan-March. I have no idea what happened from June-Dec, but eight months passed without supplies, and all the while my insurance company was being billed, and they paid for supplies I never received.\\n\\nI called today and spoke with a nice RT, who put me on hold, and a new person, whom I presume was a supervisor spoke with me. This person was very condescending and essentially shit all over me. It's worth noting that I am very laid back and I don't get upset or yell, or any other douchey behavior. I can't help but see that people who tantrum get more when they encounter these situations, but that's not me, so I tried to explain what happened and asked her to mail me my supplies, that were still missing since June. This woman was clearly annoyed and said that I should have called them and told them about the problem. I reminded her that I had called several times since June, and was still waiting. The woman told me that \\\"normal people\\\" call sooner, and that I had a month from the time they were supposed to ship it, to call and advise them that I never got the package. I am unsure how I am supposed to know when they are sending me things, when  they are eight months late in sending me my last supplies. Perhaps I should employ a psychic? I asked her how they could bill my insurance for things that I never receive, and she essentially said that they don't know I didn't receive them. So now I am a liar too, which is nice.  \\n\\nAll in all, I don't think you should have to micro-manage a company who is supposed to have their act together. Mistakes will happen, and that's ok, but when a mistake does happen, don't treat your customers like shit, and tell them that they are doing it all wrong. The bigger issue is that when I am telling them I never received the shipment, I am told that it must have been stolen. I told her that since I hadn't received my supplies in 8 months, a more likely scenario is that they never sent it, but she said that it had been sent. So miraculously, all my Amazon.com packages were safe from the roving thieves pillaging my neighborhood, but a small, light box from them was stolen? Uhh, ok- that makes sense.\\n\\nTo recap, it's forgivable to mess up shipping something, but it is unforgivable to treat a customer so poorly, and to bill for items that were never shipped or received.

The next day, we found out from the day manager, that a King Size non smoking room was infact available that night. Our honeymoon was ruined. We spent the night in separate beds, given a room with only 1 bar of soap, no towels or toilet paper and we were lied to about King Size availability. We were not given any comps or money.

The beds were actually pretty comfortable, but the shower was really bad. It took me about 5 minutes each morning to get hot water, and the shower head is really short! I mean, I'm 5'2\\\" and it was short for me. My brother is 6'3\\\" and he could barely take a shower. That's just a little obnoxious. The other really bad thing about the hotel are the doors. There is a large gap between the bottom of the door and the floor, which lets you hear EVERYTHING! Yes the beds were comfortable, but being able to hear every single step outside and having to listen to the drunk people make their way back to their room at 2 in the morning made me a very grumpy person when I had to go to my business conference. I have stayed in several hotels on the strip over the past few years, and I must say that this was the worst experience I have ever had!\\n\\nPlus, I did not have a dollar to tip the bell hop to store my bags when the hotel would not let me check out late (even after playing 12 hours of blackjack during my stay), I was going to tip him when I picked up my bags after I grabbed some cash, but he was so rude to me for not giving him a tip I decided not to. Yes, I'm sorry I didn't have a $1 right there, but come on!\\n\\nOnto the gaming:\\n\\nThe only reason that I did not give this hotel a 1 star was for their blackjack rules. It was refreshing to see a establishment offer 3 to 2 odds on blackjack at $10 tables. Now...onto the bad. I usually play $25, two deck tables in CA. MGM had 6 deck $25 tables and 6 deck $10 tables...what benefit would I have to be forced to play $25 a hand versus $10??? I found out later, they only give you comps if you play on the $25 tables...wtf? I played for 12 hours (yes, that's not even exaggerating....I asked the \\\"MLife\\\" club) and all I earned was $9.91 in comps. Maybe I'm spoiled at Barona in CA, but if I play over 8 hours there on a $5 table no less, I would earn a free night in there hotel (at minimum, I would at least get dinner). I think it's disgusting how poorly they comp their players. One guy who was sitting next to me for a few hours on Thursday was playing $40 a hand and they would not even comp him the cigarettes he asked for. I'm not a smoker, but I still think they should have given the guy something. But sure enough, even the pit bosses agreed that the casino just doesn't comp for playing at the $10 tables. She actually told me I would be better off playing slots! I had one dealer pretty much tell me the casino was broke, so that's why the comps suck now. Wish I would have known that before I put 12 hours of play in at the MGM grand hotel.\\n\\nNot only will I never go back here to stay again, but I am sure I will never play at this casino again either until they fix their comps. \\n\\nPoor form MGM Grand!\\n\\nOh, and before I forget, beware the $22 fee PER DAY they charge you to use the internet, phones, and to have access to the cardio room (in theory you get a newspaper too). Not that I used ANY of that (I already pay $30 a month for internet access on my Ipad and I have a freaking Cell Phone!). You do not get the option to not have the resort fee...they just tack it on at the end. So, you pretty much have to add $22 a night to whatever price you get for your room.",

We thought he was a little too casual given we didn't have a working relationship yet but were excited about the possibilities of hosting our event there. Dennis was aware that we expected to be paying for the rehearsal dinner ourselves and were very specific on the way the evening was to be planned; he offered the front area or the back room for our group of 18 and we settled on the back room for ease of chatting without yelling. When Dennis sent over the proposal, he listed the front room as our selection, I emailed him back and clarified that we had settled on the back room, he said \\\"Not a problem, I will note the change.\\\"  We were in the front area when we arrived for rehearsal dinner and ended up having to up-heave the entire group after about 20-30 minutes of being in the front area because we mistakenly thought we were in the front because we were \\\"early\\\" when we were actually right on time.  So our very sweet server, Stephanie, politely and quickly moved us to the back room, which, by the way, was in no way set up for us and we ended up moving the tables ourselves.  The two of us getting married didn't even get to sit next to one another at our own rehearsal dinner because of the poor planning and preparation on the part of Kokopelli!\\nLet's back track a bit.  From day one, Dennis NEVER mentioned a thing about a corking fee ($10 per bottle corked on premises). So when I had emailed him about possibly adding a 1/6 or 1/4 keg to our reception wine order, he responded with the corking fee \\\"By the way..\\\" note, 2 days before the wedding. 2 DAYS. Since he had \\\"included it in the original quote but didn't specify the fee,\\\" he would split it with us for $5 a bottle.  Gee, so generous of you Dennis, thanks. SO we gave the specific instruction to him that NO bottle was to be corked by the servers, and yes we were supposed to have 2 servers but had 1 for a party of 18, unless we specifically requested it. Let's add to that the fact that I emailed Dennis about the keg and received no price quote no matter how many times I requested it until he told me, in the same corking email 2 days before the wedding, that the 1/6 of a keg would cost $75. AND we would have to provide the 25 lbs of ice. Like I have nothing else going on the day of my wedding than to get ICE for the keg?!?  \\nAt dinner, my fiancee had to ask the server what the issue was since food took over an hour after we ordered it to start to trickle to the group, and by trickle I mean some people finished as some were just getting their meal. \\\"Another large party's food was prepared before\\\" ours, funny because we didn't see another large party when we arrived to the FRONT, and ours would be \\\"right out.\\\" When some of the chicken dishes arrived, they did not reflect the description in the menu, leading us to believe they ran out of the original.   \\nSo after the borderline disastrous rehearsal dinner, saved of course by the company we were with, my fiancee told the server that we were not pleased. It was not her fault, but more Dennis', who wasn't even there to insure the event was a success. As someone who has worked in the restaurant industry, I think he should have AT LEAST made an appearance at some point as he was our only contact regarding the event and it started at 6pm, a time he could have shown his face for. So Stephanie took my fiance's phone number and said she would pass along our comments.  \\nFor the record, my parents paid for the rehearsal dinner, an unexpected and sweet gesture that was part of what made the event salvageable. So the next morning, wedding day, Dennis calls my fiancee and during the conversation, my fiancee, asks about the possibility of changing out the keg for some bottled beers as the $75 for 1/6 of a keg was not what we had expected.  Dennis' response?  \\\"I don't have to pick up the keg!\\\"  Never asked you to order it!  Take a moment and let that sink in because it's about to get better.  When she also mentioned the overall dissatisfaction regarding the event and the way everything was handled, his response was....\\\"Well, it's not like you ended up paying.\\\"  Is this guy seriously supposed to be a professional manager/owner of a business?!?!  Not once did he offer to right the wrongs that occurred, not ONCE. Oh, and by the way, he did mention that we had consumed 11 bottles of wine during the rehearsal dinner so we must have enjoyed ourselves and my spouse stated that when your food takes over an hour to be served, that tends to happen. Insert cricket noises here.\\nWhen we ran out of beer very early at our reception, I emailed and asked for an itemized receipt of the wine and beer to see what we were charged/paid for. It took a week to get it and even still, not itemized.  I got a breakdown of what Dennis \\\"remembers.\\\"  Sorry guys, that doesn't cut it.",

That being my first time topping a steak with anything, it was okay, but I didn't enjoy it as I should have.  The side of mashed potatoes and the veggies were just as big as the steak.

He could concisely explain the objectives, strengths and potential drawbacks of any game and did so without a hint of arrogance.

We were left to browse and offered guidance whenever we wanted some. Bryan provided me with good information about an out-of-print game I'd been hoping to find, helped my 6 year-old find appropriate-yet-fun games, and invited grandma to the family game night on Friday so we could try out one of the more expensive games we're considering. \\n\\nI'm Board! has a generous, points-based rewards program for returning customers.

This place was beautiful; 20 feet ceiling draped in chandeliers, expansive skyline views and a romantic ambiance. The food was amazing with arugula salad, pasta, flank steak with pureed potatoes and a cheesecake topped with various berries. Now the groupon deal stated that 4 courses will be accompanied by a bottle of wine. The problem: the waiter who clearly found no interest in interacting with us after tossing us our pre-planned menus groupon had chosen, seemed to purposefully set us up. My boyfriend asked our waiter which wine came with the dinner and he opened up the wine list and pointed to one page. Now the prices varied up to $100+, so my bf asked several times, \\\" so any of these wines come with the deal.\\\". The waiter hastily stated yes, yes, yes. So we chose a $94 Cabernet with our meal. We had a lovely evening together until the bill came. Now don't get me wrong, we came to Las Vegas to spend money but voluntarily. Not only did the bill include a  $55 dollar gratuity but also the price of the wine plus tax. WHOA! We signaled for our waiter and informed him of his apparent mistake, but he seemed to no longer speak proper English. So the manager was summoned and we let him hear our grievance quietly as to not disturb the other guest, He stated, \\\"Why would you believe that a $94 bottle of wine would be included in the meal?\\\" We explained the exchange with the waiter (seriously my BF asked at least 5 times) and the groupon deal. At this point I'm starting to get ticked off because the manager was just being condescending and dismissive. After 6 minutes of an all out discussion, I said, \\\" Just pay the bill so I can write a review.\\\" Then the manager seemed to change his tune. All in all, we walked away paying $22 for the gratuity but it ruined my whole surprise Las Vegas vacation. I will never return to the Palms nor the Nove  EVER AGAIN!",

It was busy like most restaurants in Vegas are on Friday so I don't hold it against the establishment.  What most people don't realize is that this is a TINY restaurant.  There are not very many tables at all.  It is insanely loud too.  The table we sat at was not even and we had to constantly shift weights on the table to keep it level.  Our order was taken pretty quickly after we arrive and we ordered some oysters for starters.  We use to live in coastal Washington so when a restaurant has oysters on the menu, we typically order them for the nostalgia they bring.  Our oysters were more than broiled, they were burned and hard to chew.  This is frankly one of the worst oyster experiences I have ever had.  Oysters should never be hard to chew.  There was liquor in them either.  Even broiled oysters should have a liquor--even if it is just a bourbon or butter based sauce, it needs to be there.  They cost us $12.49 for a plate of inedible chew-balls from the sea.  They were tiny too--like the size of dimes for the oyster meat--or, at least what was left of the oysters after the kitchen got their fiery hands on them! Because I understand that not every dish is created equally I still held my hopes high for the main course.\\n\\nThose hopes were drowned by the 50 minute wait time from appetizer to entree.  We watched guests that were seated after us be served their dishes well in advance of us.  We really felt ignored.  Our waitress filled our water glasses once during the entire night--even though we were there a few hours.  \\n\\nI ordered the Catfish platter which on the menu has a number 3 beside it, indicating there would be 3 fillets.  Because I spent a lot of time in the South and I love \\\"bronzed\\\" catfish I ordered mine to be the same.  I must note that bronzed fish in no way translates to dried, black, inedible fish.  When my plate finally arrived it had one very blackened piece of fish on it.  My fish was so dry I quit eating shortly after I started.   The seasoning was over salted as well.  The waitress never came to ask how my dish was either.  I was very disappointed.  For one piece of dried out horrible fish, it racked up the bill another $15.   My fiance ordered the the Shrimp Creole ($15.99) and his shrimp were also over cooked but not to the point where they were inedible.  So, he shared with me.   My daughter ordered a plain Caesar salad ($8.99) because there were no children's options and she is a vegetarian (this place is NOT vegetarian friendly at all--they actually make a point of hinting at that on the menu: most things are non-vegetarian and they make no acceptations or substitutions!  God forbid some grits not have chicken stock in them.)   \\n\\nWe ordered two glasses of  wine and were given the wrong type of wine or a very poor substitution for what we ordered.  The sodas are also pretty expensive so make sure you are prepared to spend 10-15 on just a few glasses of coke if you order this.  Our bill went over $100 which is sad since 1/2 of the items we ordered were cooked wrong and even things we could not eat.    \\n\\nIt's been a few weeks since our visit here and I still have eater's remorse.  We wont come back to eat here ever again.  We're still on the hunt for a good Cajun place in Vegas--- *sighs*",

There were a few people sitting in the bar area (including staff) and only one table of diners in the front dining room.  They brought us to the back dining room where there wasn't another person in there.  Then...we waiting 10 minutes for someone to acknowledge us.  I finally caught the eye of a waitress...she rolled her eyes and came over.  She took our drinks orders with a scowl on her face.  Lovely.  I ordered water 'without' lemon and my husband ordered a beer.  Another 10 minutes later our drinks arrived....mine was a water WITH lemon...and not just any lemon....a brown, nasty lemon!!

We both send our meals back, but we didn't want anything else....except the garlic bread!  (My husband was an angry bear at this point and needed to choke something down to stave off the anger...I mean hunger).  \\n\\nBy this time, another waitress (one that actually smiled) delivered the garlic bread.

Maybe you can't spend the night, but you can get into the swanky pool! Just get (tastefully) dolled up and try and blend in with a group as they get off the pool elevator.

Made with only top shelf tequila, you can assure that your $15 per drink won't go to waste.\\n\\nNow to the great:\\n- The service is on point. Filling my glass and refilling my sauce as soon as it's almost empty, and explained the overwhelming menu very well.\\n- The sauce is redonkulous! Has a nice kick to it and isn't the ordinary blended sauce you will find in tex-mex establishments. Has a lot of flavor and chunks of great tomatoes in there.\\n\\nAnd finally, the awesome:\\n- My table did a little family style ordeal, so I was able to try a variety of dishes.

The beds were very comfortable and felt almost new. The rooms are rather big and loaded with extras. For the low price at M.S.S. you get a room that you wouldn't expect to see in a down town hotel. I liked how the house keepers kept our room very clean without ever disturbing our personal items.\\n\\nThe buffet was one of the best I've had in Vegas, better than the Orleans and almost as good as the Rio. I do have one gripe with the buffet though; the website advertised lower prices than they actually had. It's not a huge deal since they are still cheaper than most Casinos' on the strip. I also liked the Triple 7 brewery. The food was very tasty and the prices were some of the cheapest I've seen anywhere in Vegas. The micro-brew they make is to die for. It's been voted best in Vegas, if you try it you'll know why.\\n\\nThe slots were pretty loose and the table game action is much better than I experienced on the strip. The table minimums are very low, roulette is my game and $3 minimum is great. The dealers are friendly and helpful if you're not an experienced player. The cocktail servers are very tastefully dressed and polite. They won't forget about you either if someone with deeper pockets comes in to the Casino. This Casino is very popular with travelers from Hawaii, let me just say they are a lot nicer to be around than drunken college kids that seem to bombard other places. Great relaxing atmosphere thanks to the staff and the regulars that visit this Casino.\\n\\nI loved the Victorian train station d\\u00e9cor. It is very authentic and tasteful; there are antiques all over the place too. They have even acquired a piece of the Berlin wall and its holding up urinals in the Casino men's room.

When I am hungry...I am H-ANGRY....and for this reason, when I order delivery, I expect fast, hot food that tastes great and can satiate the animal in my gut before I smash the fridge!\\n\\nWe have ordered from Zella's multiple times.  Each time, the food was delivered quickly and came to our door hot, which on its own, definitely isn't worth 5 stars because these are things you expect from a delivery place, especially when you live a mile away.\\n\\nWhat sets Zella's apart is the quality of the food.  We have ordered multiple items  and below is a breakdown:\\n\\nBaked Fries:  ORDER THESE!  It doesn't matter what kind...all are MIND NUMBINGLY GOOD. We have tried several and they come SUPER hot, and covered in sauce/toppings/cheese etc.  This place has some magical way of baking the fries so that most of the fries are CRISPY.....EVEN WITH ALL THE CRAZY TOPPINGS!!!  This being said...if you are on a diet, STILL ORDER THESE.  You can do an extra mile or ten on the treadmill the next day and it is WORTH IT.\\n\\nWings: Boneless or bone-in?  Either.  The bone-in come NOT breaded, just crispy and not swimming in sauce.  The hot buffalo sauce might be from out of a bottle (I honestly don't know), but who cares! The wings are not swimming in it and are not those gross, fatty, grisly kind that some places serve.  The boneless wings are breaded but actually contain meat, and not just breaded grisle.  What's more: despite being sauced, the breading is still crispy and the wings are hot! Crazy!\\n\\nTOASTED SUBS:  I put that in caps because they are AMAZING.  They aren't the run-though-a-toaster kind that some places offer.  They are buttered and Panini pressed or something.....again, I am not sure quite how it is done, but they come hot, crusty, buttery, and AMAZING.  Full disclosure: I even tried the veggie one.  AND IT BLEW MY MIND.  A sub without meat!?  Being amazing?! Yes.  Somehow....even their veggie toasted sub is amazing.\\n\\nPizza:  Their pizza is pretty good.  To be honest, we have not tried many of the options available but it did come hot, not too saucy and the crust was crispy.  Great pizza is easy to find here in Gilbert and Zella's is definitely better than mediocre. They offer choices for crust flavorings, which seems to be the standard now for pizza places.  What stands out is the price.  It is way better pizza than what they charge so if you have a bunch of hungry kids or pizza party or something, you are better off getting this instead of the Diabetes-inducing-garbage other chains out there call pizza.....and at least you can enjoy it as an adult.\\n\\nBurger:  Oddly....it was REALLY good (which you do not expect from a pizza/cheesesteak place).  The patties are not exactly chargrilled (like on a home grill) but they are juicy.  They remind me of a bigger version of a fast food patty (which, if you are like me, you know you LOVE....deep down inside....but pretend not to!). They are not overly huge but not tiny either and it comes with 2 patties already.  The best part: YOU CAN ADD EXTRA PATTIES!!!!  So for instance....IF I want to, I can have my own burger-food-challenge every night in the comfort of my own home....and do it in my underwear!!!  The only downside is that the burger toppings appeared to be the same toppings they use on the pizza, but honestly...can you blame them!?  And it is not like my burger was any less awesome because of it.\\n\\nFRIED PICKLES:  Personally, I prefer the coins to the spears (most people do, for those that know what I am talking about!).  That being stated, let me ask you.....Have you ever had a BAD fried pickle??  I thought not.  And you won't find a bad one here.\\n\\nCustomer Service:  I say it in every review I write:  good food is easy to find but good customer service is rare.  This place shines.  If they goof up your order, they are apologetic and do everything in their power to make it right, trust me, I know. No matter how good food is, no place is worth ordering from if they treat you like garbage.  This place does an amazing job of making its customers feel important and valued.\\n\\nOVERALL:  Delivery was fast and food came hot.  The price is extremely fair for how good the food is.  Customer service is exceptional, though that is not to say there have not been a few bumps in our order history, but they have been resolved straight away.  All food we have ordered has been exceptional and better than what they charge for it. \\n\\nBOTTOM LINE:  It has something for everyone. The potential to create a GIANT burger will appease the meat lovers.  Vegetarians can love the veggie options (which are ACTUALLY YUMMY!).  Pizza lovers will enjoy the ability to create a delicious pizza that doesn't taste like plastic and NOT break the bank.

My friend also had a $50 gift certificate, which the person who gave it to him, must really have ill wishes towards him in life.  Wow! I now understand why people dislike Lolita's so much! When entering the place, I thought the hostess (a nice sweet girl who seemed like she had already checked out of the place the first time they went under and probably laughed inside at about what we had yet to experience) looked decent and sane enough to trust that if it was really that bad, she wouldn't work there.  The environment was much less than exciting and there was zero music playing. While being seated at the least desired table in the room (actually it was in the bar, not the dining area) I looked to my right and noticed the fleet of idiots with their laptops and cellular's out. I didn't realize that Lotia's doubled as a convention overflow hangout. Our waiter came up to grab our drink order, I was already not in the mood to have any booze in my system, thinking that I wanted to run out the doors rather than spend one more minute in that place. (Free or not!) It didn't take too long for my friend and I to realize that the owners and staff took this place as a complete joke. This was confirmed when, what looked like the owner, came somewhere out of the back very loud and completely unaware that he was rudely interrupting his guests dinners. The \\\"owner looking\\\" guy joined the rest of the group who were clearly working so hard on their laptops and conversations with future clients, beginning each conversation with, \\\"Oh my God!\\\" or \\\"Like,,,sooo\\\".  What I was wondering the entire time we had come in was actually true, the group in the front of the restaurant were employees of the restaurant.  Our server was nice, took our order, brought it out in a timely fashion and made sure our drinks were well taken care of. The salsa was hardly flavorful, and definitely not spicy.  The guac was great. The steak burrito that my friend ordered looked like a burrito that one would order at Qudoba only nowhere as close to the quality of Qudoba and with less steak and the chili relleno, that I ordered was stuffed with multiple ingredients and had three different sauces poured over it.  The rice and beans, chili rellenos, and salsa all had the same sweet, unflavored taste. It all tasted the same, not bad but not worth the price, not like Mexican food and certainly not contemporary. There is a phenomenal contemporary Mexican restaurant in Denver, CO and it's called Tamayo. (Located on 15th and Market, downtown). Perhaps Lolita's should take a lesson from this restaurant. The cuisine was confusing and there was zero atmosphere. The atmosphere was only the employees, owners and marketing team chatting to one another on how to make their \\\"third chance\\\" work. Jesus H. Christ! Do you think you, Mr. Owner man, you should really be running a restaurant considering you've already been given multiple chances at being successful?  If you need to have a business meeting and have to do it in the restaurant, think twice and maybe try doing it out of the sight of your guests.

You could have gotten tickets on craigslist for cheaper than LVMS' retail price.  I'm sure many were given away and sold by their bearers.

She was hostile to me, my agent and his broker and rude. \\n\\nIn efforts to find her boss I found a more prominent profile wrote to him, Bob Ratliff, who is a great guy and I feel bad this seems to have got him in trouble with these two pieces of work, he offered to refund my money. He is actually just an agent under her but should be her boss frankly, the money, for the sake of integrity and the sake of a relationship, was coming out of his pocket. Tim Kuptz put an end to that and insisted he COULD NOT refund me my 75 dollars. In addition I am assuming they punished him and forced him to write a review on Yelp under my one star review of Sandra Thomas but that will be removed as he is an employee, it just amazes me they would rather pocket 75 dollars than build relationships not to mention their unethical business practices.

Funny thing is, the restaurant itself wasn't really what I was expecting but that was actually a good thing. What I mean by that is Daily Dose is actually, well, a restaurant. I was kind of expecting more of a typical Old Town bar/restaurant (which isn't necessarily a bad thing), but nope. It's really just a casual dining spot. When I was here there were people of all different ages (not just 20/30 somethings you'd expect to see at HH in Old Town) & I think I even spotted a few families with kids, and that didn't seem weird at all because like I said, this is more casual dining, not just a bar that serves food. \\n\\nAs far as HH goes, the food menu is great! Daily Dose has SEVERAL fairly cheap options with lots of variety and good sized portions. As far as drinks go (and I should note, at this current time I'm unable to drink alcohol for medical reasons so this wasn't a big concern of mine) I actually didn't think the drink specials were all THAT great for HH. I mean, they were obviously cheaper compared to regular prices and still good deals, but there are several bars in Old Town where the HH drink specials are little cheaper. That being said they have several beers on tap, and a few of which are hard to come by so that's always good!\\n\\nAs far as the food goes, we honestly didn't try all that much. We had chips, salsa, and guac. I liked Daily Dose's salsa. It's chunky & has a bit of (what I think was) tomatilla flavor. I also liked there guac. I'm normally not a big fan of real chunky guac, which is what Daily Dose has, but for whatever reason I like theirs. We also got pretzels w/cheese. The pretzels were soft & chewy, which is what I prefer & I liked the cheese sauce (it had a little kick to it). The one thing I wasn't all that crazy about was the chorizo mac & cheese. I thought the cheese was kind of runny & there wasn't a whole lot of chorizo. It wasn't bad though. I'd like to come back to Daily Dose to try (a lot) of other things on the menu. \\n\\nOverall, I like this place. It's very casual for Old Town & they have a rally nice patio (w/a nice TV).

And makes me sad that I don't live closer.\\n\\nThe ordering process was confusing, but the friend I went with knew the system and would have been able to make it happen. However, it was a little slow when we went in and the cashier not only took our order, she let me sample anything I wanted to try after my friend told her it was our first time eating there. They get one star alone for that! I ended up with a jerk chicken quesadilla which was the perfect combination of cheese, spice and crisp tortilla. I will analyze the crap out of a quesadilla because it's one of my four child-like food groups and this was the Rolls Royce of quesadillas. It wasn't overly greasy as quesadillas tend to be (you can't avoid it...I mean essentially it's just melted fat), the cheese was melted perfectly and the jerk chicken brought the heat without sacrificing flavor.\\n\\n I think I got some kind of chicken (jade chicken?) as well which I remember being good, but not as good as the black beans. Oh the beans.  Did you know that magic beans aren't just a key proponent to a much-loved children's story? They are also on the menu at Chino Bandido and served in almost gargantuan portions. They're kind of sweet, savory and the texture is so smooth, almost like a bean dip. It's sprinkled with cheese and can honestly be eaten as a meal itself (which I'm totally tempted to do next time). I didn't finish the rest of my food, but did use my tortilla scraps to scrape up every bit of that glorious bean concoction!\\n\\nThe portions are overwhelming to say the least, so I think you get what you pay for plus some. I was so full after that I was ready to petition for a nap room in the restaurant and was really glad I wasn't the one driving afterwards!

Another had a\\\"bloody mary\\\", which came \\\"up\\\", containing pepper/cilantro infused vodka, which was greatly liked, especially the gigantic shrimp that came with it!

Hopefully my experience will touch most of my followers and other people that are writing reviews about this hotel that was formerly under the Harrah's name and is now under Caesars Entertainment that is widely more recognizable. \\n\\nIf I were to give a rating, this hotel should never receive 1 star, more likely a negative star rating. We all knew that formerly known as Imperial Palace has become The Quad Resort and Casino. Still under construction and probably one of the cheapest hotels on the main strip for last minute plans or bookings. In general, customer service is customer service, whether your a casino or not, whether your hotel rewards comps or not, whether your rich or poor or making ends meat. In the end customer service is customer service, and should always end with a smile and some satisfactory.\\n\\nWe arrived at the hotel in Las Vegas around 01:30pm in the afternoon. Seeing signs that check in is around 04:00pm. by the main line. Keep in mind I booked the room through an online site www.bookit.com, which is an excellent site to do hotel bookings compared to most competitors and has cheaper deals. So we arrived at the hotel and saw that there are 2 different lines available one for regular guest and one for Total Rewards Gold members. We went through the Total Rewards line for early check in not knowing if we have to pay an early check in fee, but we didn't care we just wanted to check in relax from the long drive So Cal. before meeting up with friends and family in the area. The lady that helped us the first time provided excellent customer service, which we don't remember her name. We were able to check in with the room we booked for. Of course, during registration, we asked to see if there any available upgrades don't minding what the possible fee would be. She said, \\\"We do have a mini suite available, let me call housekeeping to see the progress of the cleaning of the room.\\\" So confirmed, housekeeping staff said it would be ready by 3pm. We killed time checking out some of the sites by the hotel and gambled a little to kill time. We go back to the service to see if the room was ready at 3pm. The 2nd hotel employee named Amwar, (sorry if the name is not exact) told us the room is not ready and will not be ready till around 4pm. And when we heard that, we were distraught with our reaction. We had plans to meet with a couple of friends and my girlfriend's cousin at the Wynn for buffet. Amwar told us, \\\"That housekeeping management was mad with the situation that the room was not ready when the first hotel service helped us and told us 45 more minutes.\\\" We called and postponed the early dinner till after 4pm. Keep in mind we wanted to change into different clothes and freshen up before eating. So we came back to the hotel service desk before 4pm for the \\\"3rd time,\\\" and still found out that our room was not ready yet. By this time, I was far beyond pissed  off and decided for me and my girlfriend to go eat and come back afterwards to grab our room  key. Up to now we have wasted almost 3 hours of trying to fix this situation to check into our hotel. 3 hours that we could of done tourist stuff in Las Vegas checking out the sites. 3 hours of gambling for fun whether we win or lose.

I asked for the manager. And I repeated myself to the manager or supervisor named Jean or Jeanie. And we get the same answer 4pm!!! She thought we were trying to get comped for the misconception. I told her no. All I wanted to know, Why did it take so long till now for us to get our room? Now remember the third time we were there 10 minutes till 4pm and the room was still not ready. There was no straight answer, she was looking at me like i am some evil person, she rolled her eyes at me after each explanation, and talked to me as if i were a kid.

It tasted light and delicious... warm bread sticks are hard to say no to... I indulged and enjoyed them.\\n\\nFor appetizer.. I ordered the Calamari Fritti. Love that it wasn't deeply fried to crisp, but just enough so you can enjoy the airy crunch and lightly breaded squid. I was given two sauces: a spicy marinara and a miso chili sauce that was in a black plastic sample cup to try out. Both sauces were delicious... the spicy marinara tasted so fresh like they just whipped that sauce together like it was made to order. The miso chili sauce was incredible in flavor... I wish they could make this in a jar to take home!!! It had this sweetness and then a tangy end note.. went very well with the calamari. I could have ate this like popcorn in a movie theater... stop only when there's nothing left :) \\n\\nFor the main entree... I ordered the Lobster Ravioli. The portion was beautiful... there were four plumply rounded raviolis with three enormously sized blackened shrimps, and three thick asparagus cooked to perfection. The pink sauce was oh so savory and the flavors were so balanced.. nothing was too rich to enjoy. The shrimp was tender and the spice gave it such an impact of delight. The ravioli was filled with a generous amount of lobster meat and the texture from the pasta itself was wonderful. Texture always gets me in pasta and this was definitely a winner. \\n\\nI can't leave an Italian restaurant without trying my favorite dessert... Tiramisu!!! Great presentation and goodness gracious was it GOOD. One bite and I was dizzy from overdrive of joy. It comes with one lady finger cookie, topped with shaved dark chocolate flakes, and the filling also had bits of this flake, which was pleasing to break in your mouth and gave it... Character. The whipped cream was heavenly... so fresh and cooling to the tongue. I imagined bathing in this, it felt so silky and smooth in my mouth... AMAZING. The breading with the filling was luscious, soft, and moist. One of the best Tiramisu I ever had. Mind blowing magnificent in Tiramisu creations. \\n\\nOverall, this place is striving with excellence.. in food and service. I came here right when they opened for dinner at 5p.m., not even 30 mins. and this whole place was packed. Must be a locals hangout or favorite. My favorite in Italian cuisine and definitely one that I rave about to many!!!",

        "sentence": "It has been a family tradition that when my family (immediate and extended) go to Las Vegas (usually as a group), we ALWAYS make the Carnival World Buffet part of our food tour.  This recent trip was no different.  We arrived in Vegas on Monday and decided it would be a \\\"fun\\\" thing to do on our first night there.  Afterall, we were tired from a day of travel, and we wanted to just relax, kick back, and begin the eating frenzy.  Wellllllll, this was anything BUT fun, but it definitely was a HUUUUUUUGE frenzy.......but not in the way we had planned.\\n\\nLet's start with the wait...........we stood in line for NINETY MINUTES just to get seated.......otherwise known as an hour and a half.  The New Year's Eve / weekend crowds were GONE.  This wasn't about dealing with THOSE crowds.  NO.  This was about dealing with the epitomy of stupidity, which created a long ass line.  In the past, they had AT LEAST 5-6 lines open, some of which were actual cashiers, and other lines for using automated machinery, usually for those paying by cash or credit card, and maybe 1 or 2 lines extra for hotel guests only.  Well, guess what....... there was only ONE LINE OPEN FOR THE WHOLE ROTTEN MESS.  Here's the kicker, though.........we got up to the front of the line and discovered that if we had walked over to one of the partitioned areas, WE COULD HAVE GOTTEN IN RIGHT AWAY.  However, NOBODY TOLD US WE COULD, and it was partitioned off as if we should stay away.  Instead of the manager or another buffet employee staying outside and making occasional announcements (as most places would do) that there were the automated machines for cash or credit card, which would have moved the lines along MUCH, MUCH faster, they instead remained silent and let all us dummies stand there for all that time, not ever knowing it was available.  I was already tired from getting up at 5am, traveling 1/2 the day, and now add in my feet were killing me from standing so long...... I seriously didn't need any added reminders telling me my body is getting old.  At this point, I'm just pissed.\\n\\nThat's not all, though.........for all 11 of us, there was a delightful table for 12.......we had our eye on it, seemed like the perfect place for us to park our stuff, but yet........it was not to be ours.  New rule..........for a group of more than 10, a mandatory gratuity of 18% was being added to the already higher buffet rate (than we remembered), and this was not the case 5 years ago.  Nor were we in ANY mood to have more annoyances thrown our way.  Yet, if we took a table for 5 plus another table right next to it for 6, we'd have our seats but without the mandatory 18% gratuity.  I think what irked us the most was when we spoke to the manager about the long lines, plus the lines that were open but no one knew about.......and his reaction was one of \\\"soooooooooo???????\\\"  Not an attitude you want to see when you're already pissed.\\n\\nThen we get to the food part.  I went here for two things, and two things only.....crab legs and peel n' eat shrinp.  That's it.  Part of the reason is because I can never get that kind of quantity anywhere in L.A. for that kind of price, and yes, I definitely ate my money's worth of crab legs and shrimp......but let me tell you......I had to work for every last bit of it.  The shrimp was definitely in need of being peeled, but why did I have to?  Why couldn't they have done it?  The crab legs that needed my cracking them, well, that was a real job.  My husband wanted no part of working at it, but I didn't mind........I wanted those crab legs, so I worked and worked and worked at it.  They brought me some plastic device to use because they were not easy to break apart, nor had the restaurant gotten the crab legs started for me.  I had to crack them entirely, and it was not easy.  Plus, there wasn't that much meat in a lot of what I got, and by the time I realized the larger crab legs were the meatier ones, I had pretty much finished.  I took my time, stuck with it, and got what I wanted.  I can't speak about any of the other foods (from everywhere around the world) only because I didn't try them.  I left room for dessert, tried a few things, and pretty much didn't like any of them.  Uninspired.  Boring.\\n\\nAll of us decided, young and old alike, that our tradition of going to the Carnival World Buffet has come to a close.  We were so pissed off by how we were treated, how they really don't give a shit about moving their lines through more quickly, and how the quality of food has gone down while the prices went up....we figured that we don't need to go there anymore.  There are many other buffets around town that would be quite happy to have our business.......with far better food.",

Nice sized vanity/dressing area also separate from the bathroom.  \\n\\n- Free Parking\\n\\nCONS: \\n- Check-in took forever.  There were only 2 couples in line in front of us, yet we stood there for a good 20+ minutes.  They had only one woman who knew what she was doing (Skip, and she was awesome!) and actually checking people in,  while some other guy (manager? relative of the owner?) buzzed around her and even jumped in to \\\"help\\\" and messed things up.    While we were standing there, someone who'd just checked in came back to say they had been checked into a dirty room, so that took even longer.\\n\\n- You may walk in on someone or have someone walk in on you.   Remember that guy buzzing around?  He  jumped in during check-in and issued us a room key while she was finishing the computer work.   ...a room key for a different room than she had checked us into.  Luckily we had read the reviews on the travel agent's site and seen that several people had this same problem and actually walked in on people, so we were on guard and caught this, and Skip fixed it for us before walking away from the counter.     We kept the deadbolt locked the entire time we were in the room in case they issued our keys to someone else later.\\n\\n- The cleanliness is iffy.  Our bedding and towels were clean and crisp, but the floor was not vacuumed (as evidenced by the remnants of orange crackers crushed into the carpet from the previous occupants), walls were dirty.\\n\\n- The parking is not in a covered or secured lot.\\n\\nCONCLUSION:\\nThis was a clean(ish), safe place to stay for pretty cheap, and other than the delayed checkin, we had no problems.    I've been in some MUCH WORSE hotels in Vegas for this price (bugs and nasty stains), so relatively speaking,  it could have been worse.  Would I stay here again?  Not if I could afford it.  But if it's all I could afford and it was a trip out of necessity, I would probably do it again.   \\n\\nI understand the hotel is under new management and that may be the source of the service/cleanliness problems we encountered, maybe they haven't figured it out yet...

Most massage therapists will ask you how the pressure is, but this guy just said \\\"how are you doing\\\" 1/2 way thru.  I took that opportunity to tell him he could apply more pressure.  I can honestly say after 50 minutes, not one inch of my body was any better than when I'd walked in.\\n\\nThe facility is beautiful, but there are no coed areas, and the day I was there, the notorious \\\"roman baths\\\" weren't even open. The tea lounge is great and the amenties are the best, so it could be a fun place for a relaxing girls spa day, but if you truly want a good massage, this is NOT the place for it.",

I've yet to sit inside, as the patio area is really wonderful.  The covered tables, the field-stone ground cover, and the \\\"alcove\\\" feel make for a relaxing and enjoyable place, even when the thermometer is pointed well into the triple digits.  There's ample shade, so that helps a bit.\\n\\nThe tap selections are excellent.  Kudos to the FHP for their great taste in micro brews.  While the offerings aren't exotic, they are well rounded and I guarantee there'll be something for everyone.\\n\\nScotch and whisky selections are decent as well; you'll find most of the usual suspects on their liquor menu.  Prices are reasonable, the two pours I had were \\\"clinical\\\" - clearly measured to the exact mL.  \\n\\nThe food and service are where the mixed feelings come into play.  The servers are friendly, but sparse.  On three of the four visits, we sat for some time between drinks; food seemed to take a long time to arrive; follow-ups were few and far between.  During one of the visits, we had an exceptionally great server who was prompt, super friendly, helpful, and great with follow-ups.  But, 1-out-of-4 does not a 4-star review make.\\n\\nFood quality has been consistently \\\"meh.\\\"  I know Wisconsin likes its food to border on the bland side, but come on.  We've tried the jalapeno poppers, which were uniquely presnted - sliced on the half, grilled, and filled with creamed cheese; aside from the jalapeno flavor they were boring.  Despite being charred, there wasn't much smoke/grill flavor, and the creamed cheese tasted like gruel.  We had high hopes for it, but were left for wanting.\\n\\nThe cheese curds were pedestrian; on par with what you'd find at any number of places.  If you're looking for a handmade curd, look elsewhere.\\n\\nFor entrees, we've tried a bunch... I won't go into tremendous detail as this would soon turn into a novel.  The sandwiches are \\\"bready\\\" and bland - chicken didn't have any unique flavor; burgers were on the dry side and the beef was \\\"lost\\\" by the toppings - a good burger should stand on its own.  \\n\\nThe salads are nice, but when adding chicken, I'd appreciate a little more than 3 - 3.5oz of flavorless chicken breast.  The loaded grilled cheese was embarrassing - someone mentioened it in a filtered review, and our experience was the same as his.\\n\\nWith each visit, we've left with a happy/sad feeling.  The drinks and atmosphere are consistently good.  The food is consistently underwhelming.  The service is consistently \\\"off.\\\"  The price is hardly ever a value; we've averaged around $48-$55 per visit for 2-3 people.\\n\\nI know it's hard to make a new place work... but I'd pay more attention to giving the food some recognizable flavor, improve the service a bit, and ease-up on the breadiness of the sandwiches.  A little tweaking, and this could be a solid place.\\n\\nThe Free House Pub = MEH\\n\\nFood = 2 stars\\nService = 2 stars\\nValue = 2 stars\\nMISC = 3.5 stars",

Then I watched the manager go behind the bar and spend a good 5 minutes just chatting with our server instead of helping her with her tables.\\n\\nWe finally got our bill and left.  Team work does not exist in this place and it starts from the manager on down but if you have a birthday to celebrate, the manager will be very quick to grab the computer that controls the music and will blast the birthday song and be focused enough to watch to see when the singing is done so she can turn the song off and turn the volume down, the she goes back to just walking around and not paying attention to tables.\\n\\nIt's sad because they all have great potential, someone just needs to train everyone to be a team instead of individuals.    Needless to say we will not be back as the value for what you got along with the lack of service & attention to customers is not a high priority.

Let me explain.\\n\\nAny time I go to a teriyaki place, I always get the chicken n beef combo because come on, you get two kinds of meat and you cant really mess that up right? Here they kind of did ok. You have two choices of sizes. Regular and Large. The large is only 50 cents more so might as well right? \\n\\nSo here's why im not too fond of this place. The chicken was dry. I had to douse it with teriyaki sauce and sriracha just to make it edible. I wanted brown rice instead of white. They charge you 40 cents for that while some other places don't. The large was not that much bigger. My total came out to 9 bucks and some change. That's without any drinks included. Easily would of been over 10 bucks if I did.\\n\\nSo I stand corrected. I never really had much of anything negative to mention. Until I ate here. The only saving grace that is preventing me from giving them 1 star is that the beef is actually good.  I have actually been here twice. Once with company that wanted to go here and this second time around because I thought the first time was a fluke.

The entire area is depressing with very little activity (it picks up on weekends). Many of the shops in the village have gone out of business (or soon will). The Ravella is not a 4-star property-- more like 3.  We had horrible service here from almost every department. \\n\\nWe booked a package and both the photos/description they provided as well as those on the Ravella web site make the area and resort look wonderful. We assumed since the hotel used to be the Ritz that it would be nice and offer excellent service, hence the reason we booked it. Having stayed on the strip most every other visit, we were ready for a change. I only wish I had done some research on the area first. Search the web for \\\"Lake Las Vegas Foreclosure\\\" and you'll get more information than you probably want. \\n\\nHere's a history of the opening of the Ravella. It used to be the Ritz Lake Las Vegas for at least 5 years. In 2009, the property got foreclosed upon (actually so did the entire Lake Las Vegas development). It is now owned by Deutsche Bank Group. Interesting note, this is the same group that owns the Cosmopolitan Hotel on the strip (which was also foreclosed on prior to opening). From what I've read online, the bank has no interest in running hotels but has been forced into it (no one will buy the hotels from them). After the Ritz left, the hotel was empty for almost a year before opening up under the Ravella name in February of this year ('11). It is now being managed by the Dolce Hotel Group.\\n\\nAs for the specific issues we encountered, I've posted a detailed review on TripAdvisor should you want to learn more about our experience. Yelp limits the amount of characters for its reviews.\\n\\nIn short, I recommend that you avoid this hotel as well as Lake Las Vegas in general. Don't make the same mistake we did.",

This is really one of the best parks in the Cactus League.\\n\\nGetting there is a breeze.  Not only does the 101 freeway run right by it, but it is just south of Bell Rd.  It is easiest to reach the complex by coming North on 83rd from Peoria (don't do Thunderbird) or Cactus and then parking at the Buca Di Beppo's across the street.  You can park there for free and, a short walk later, you will be at the front gate.\\n\\nOnce you are in, the exterior concourse is filled with food options that only a Carny could love.  Fried Oreos, Twinkies, and something called Taco in a Bag (crushed Fritos or Doritos topped with beans, salsa, lettuce, and cheese).  There are gyros, bbq, sausages, Dodger Dogs-corndogified, and many of the traditional ballpark food options.  Prices range depending on where you are so look around.\\n\\nThe grass is some of the best in the Cactus League and allows fans to watch the pitchers warm up in the bullpen as well as catch the game.  Most of the seats are on the smaller size and have not been updated since 1993.  The exception is the upperdeck where, in 2008, new padded seats were installed.  Those seats also feature a waiter who will get you anything you need from the main concession stand.  There is a concession stand up stairs for those seats and there is also a bathroom.  Very nice amenities for tickets that usually hover around $26.  For shaded seats, sit in either the 200 or 300 sections.  The third base line gets more shade than the first.\\n\\nPlayer access is somewhat spotty.  Both teams use the practice fields to warm up and do their drills so you won't find them on the field until about an hour before the game starts.  Once they start coming out, you can camp out down the right field line to get all of the players as they come on the field.  If you want a better spot, cross the bridge into the right field berm and go down the hill.  There is a fence that all of the players walk by and most will sign there as opposed to once they get on the field.\\n\\nThe best part of Peoria Sports Complex is that they tend to host more night games than the other stadiums.  There are usually 3 or 4 every year which is great for locals who can't take a month off of work.  \\n\\nMy only gripe is with the employees.  The place is staffed with volunteer retired Sun City people.  They are grumpy and always on a power trip.  They always want to check your ticket (even when both hands are full of food) and act like they are the last line of defense between the terrorists and the field.

One minute we were drinking and having fun, the next all the lights went on and we were ushered out into the bar for no reason. Or, at least not a reason my group could figure out. \\n\\nThe group of bars in the area where Whisky River is located seem like fun, but the plaza is still under construction and it was a little hard to tell where things were located. We popped into Blackfinn too but it was v. v. crowded. Whisky River is prob. more geared towards the \\\"just out of college, just want to drink and dance\\\" crowd, and if that's your scene you'll enjoy it. If it's not, go somewhere else.",

        "sentence": "I came to Cafe Sam with high hopes.  Ritter's Diner is directly across the street and I eat there all the time.  In my mind a place can only  get better.  As our party of three walks in we are promptly seated by the manager.  Looking over the menu, we all decide on what we want and order:\\n\\nFrench Onion\\nBuffalo Chicken Medallions \\nFish Tacos with salsa and guacamole\\nCheeseburger (medium) with apple sauce and potato salad\\nSide of Fries\\nWater and Iced Tea with Lemon\\n\\nBread with butter, olive oil infused with pumpkin, and our drinks soon arrive.  ALERT: The tea is flavored.  I really do dislike flavored teas, but I put extra lemon in mine to cover the foul taste and continued on.  The bread was slightly aged as the crust was somewhat hard.  The olive oil was fairly tasteless, but fresh.  I would never use a light olive oil for tasting purposes like Cafe Sam did.  While it was an interesting thought to add pumpkin seeds -- this is the current theme -- they didn't add that much to the oil.  At least the butter was soft rather than frozen.\\n\\nAs we planned work for the next next day, our Buffalo Chicken Medallions arrived.  They need to remove the \\\"s\\\" from Medallions as there was only piece.  In fact, they need to remove \\\"medallion\\\" and \\\"buffalo\\\" from the name and call it something else.  It was just a piece of chicken breast dredged in Cajun seasoning with a few stray strands of cheese melted on it.  Don't get me wrong, it didn't taste bad; but a better name would have been \\\"Cajun Chicken Breast\\\" rather than what they call it now.  As I ate the chicken, the French Onion Soup arrived.  This crock of soup looked exceptionally good.  The cheese on top was browned to the proper point.  I took the spoon and cut in with a voraciousness as I could taste it already.  When I put the first bite in my mouth though, the flavor was flat.  I took another bite and it was the same thing.  This wasn't French Onion soup with layers of flavor, but an onion broth that had some cheap, melted cheese on top.  It didn't taste bad, but anyone could make this soup.\\n\\nI ate half the soup and passed it on to my friend to finish along with the rest of the chicken breast.  I didn't want to eat too much and then not be able to eat the main course.  \\n\\nAs my friend finished the soup our entrees arrived.  The cheeseburger was served on a piece of a larger sesame baguette and came well done rather than the requested medium.  I didn't try it due to the fact it was overcooked and had sesame seeds.  I did try the apple sauce and the potato salad, though.  The potato salad was just not tasty.  One bite and I didn't want to take another.  The apple sauce, on the other hand, was quite tasty -- I wouldn't call it apple sauce, though.  It was more along the line of fried apples -- some damn tasty fried apples.\\n\\nAs I wasn't having any of the cheeseburger, I ate all of the fish tacos.  The tacos arrived presented on a sprinkling of iceberg lettuce.  I would think that they should make it a bed of lettuce or just omit it all together.  I am for the latter over the former as I don't eat iceberg lettuce -- no nutrients, just water.  While the fish didn't have bad flavor, it was a tad overcooked.  When I started to eat the tacos, this wasn't a big deal.  As the fish cooled off, though, they started to get too hard for their own good.  The fish tacos need to be cooked less, especially with the fact that they are using white, flaky fish, which is easily overcooked.  At least the guacamole was fresh and tasted good.\\n\\nAll in all, this was a lackluster event.  If not for the fried apples, guacamole, and great service this would have been a one-star.  I don't know that I would ever willingly return since I was in sticker shock when our server brought our check.  The price was not commensurate with the quality of the food.  People complain about the quality of the food at Ritter's diner, but the food is actually commensurate to the price that you pay.

However, the service here is a bit lacking. \\n\\nThere were a lot of waitresses that night and they were huddling around the bar anticipating whether or not it'd be a busy night as I heard through their conversations. It was really dead and it was my first time there so I had no idea how it was on a busy night. I was really hungry while waiting for more people to arrive so I ordered a beef wrap and some hummus. Both weren't bad at all. I thought it was weird that the server took my card and opened up a tab for me as I was intentionally planning on not drinking that night, but I didn't say anything about it to her anyway. \\n\\nMore people started arriving about an hour later and the lounge gradually started filling up as well. We had a whole row of seats and couches for our party, but as more people started showing up the servers started to get anxious as we were flowing out of the specific area they had for us. There were also several hookahs out. It seemed as if they didn't want all that business for them or couldn't handle that many people. \\n\\nThey ended up making all of us get up and relocate into this bland side room which was away from all the music so it was a really weird atmosphere. It wasn't as comfortable as the lounge seating they had for typical guests, but they said we were taking up too much room out there apparently. \\n\\nWe did not get much service in this room either. I understand it turned into a pretty busy night, but I think they could've used another waitress or two to staff our large party. When I finally received my tab at the end of the night, I noticed they double charged me on my bill. The waitress seemed a little upset about this even though it wasn't my fault claiming that someone else had charged me extra, not her, but she refunded me in cash so it was okay. The whole ordeal and events of the night made me feel like I never wanted to come back again. At least the people I was with made the night a little more enjoyable.",

The short version is that Aveda Institute Phoenix's Cosmetology Team Lead, Aveda Certified Educator,  self-proclaimed Color Specialist, and the 2014 Inspire Greatness Champion, ANGIE PERINO NELSON, did not follow verbal or written instructions that I provided her. (I said and wrote \\\"apply color to new growth only.\\\" She put color 5\\\" down my head. I said I wanted to go 1 to 2 shades lighter than my standard Aveda formula I have used for 6 years: 30 vol 60 grams of Deep 10-N @ 40 mins. This provided me with Golden Honey Blond. The sun provided me with multi-dimensionality and sun-kissed streaks. Parts of my hair looked like spun gold and others were like pale blonde sunny streaks. Because I have worn my hair the SAME way in all my outdoor jobs, the outer shell of my hair was very light. She formulated 40 vol 60 grams of Deep 12-N @ 45 mins in a shower cap.  \\n\\nMy crown turned Polar Bear White. When I became upset, she said, and I quote, \\\"Sometimes this happens. Blondes are hard.\\\" Then she said she'd fix it. So she formulated this toner: 40g 0-N + 40g of 10-N + 1g of Light Yellow + 40mL of CTA. Unfortunately, she toned all 3 feet of my hair--not just the Polar Bear White part. The result was my crown became a monochromatic Electric Butter Yellow and the rest of my multidimensional golden honey blond hair became shades of Straw Yellow and included some Pumpkin Orange. It wasn't in shades of blond but in shades of YELLOW as in Crayola Crayon shades of yellow. Angie Perino Nelso wouldn't face me at this point and was conveniently absent for the final review of my hair, and a senior manager told me to come back for a free color correction. \\n\\nI learned after the fact from other Aveda Institute Educators from around the country that 40 vol us used on people with black or chocolate brown hair. I am naturally dark blond; have fair, yellow-toned skin; and green eyes. How could she not notice this? I also learned she used the LIGHTEST POSSIBLE Lift-Color-Method possible: 40vol/Deep 12-N/Shower cap. I was also told that \\\"no one\\\" tones blond hair that is 3 feet long. Because the initial color chemical was so strong, when it washed out of my hair, it stripped color from the rest of my hair because it was still developing 45 minutes later. My scalp even turned white. \\n\\nAngie Perino Nelson is arrogant, reckless, and does not understand blonding.  She should advertise at her other job, Mood Swings Salon, that she is a color specialist sans blonding. This will take me 6 years to grow out damaged hair and about $1K to make it live-able.

The Ogden was overrun with young, drunk, high hipsters who had no regard for their neighbors. I thought we had at least moved away from that but I was mistaken. The quality and safety of the neighborhood, both inside and outside of the building, seems to have deteriorated lately.\\n\\nA few weeks ago on Saturday morning I was walking my dog on the sidewalk near the West entrance and was accosted by a man clearly under the influence of something who saw me and made a path straight towards me. I was able to deal with him and offered him a handful of dog poop in his face if he didn't turn around and walk away. Just a couple of days ago, I was once again harassed by a drunk man on the East side of the building who thought I wanted to hug him. No thank you.\\n\\nMost of the time, the Security guards are either sitting behind the building smoking, talking on their cell phone, or lounging in a chair at the Concierge desk almost asleep. Yesterday I saw what must have been the only Security person on duty lounging in the office at the front of the building, playing with an ipad. They seem very detached, uninterested and indifferent to the residents, who should be here, what should be going on, what shouldn't be going on and what their jobs entail. As far as I can tell, they are doing absolutely nothing here to add to the safety or the quality of life in this building. \\n\\nIt also seems that lately the resident population has taken a downturn. I see a lot of poorly behaved people who appear to have no upbringing, no manners, no respect for others. Alone, they're questionable, then they bring their friends over to hang out by the pool. At any given time I would guess that the Guest to Resident ratio at the pool is about 5 to 1. I won't even go out there because I don't enjoy the noise, the loud music and birthday parties for kids that probably don't even live here - really?! If I wanted a pool party, I would go to Encore Beach Club. At home, a little more peace, quiet and civility would be great.\\n\\n\\nThe back gate of the parking garage continues to be an issue. Several times a week I come home to find a car loitering outside the gates just waiting for someone who lives here to come along and open it so they can tailgate in. Although the sign says \\\"No Tailgating\\\", the gate has a sensor that stops it and opens it back up when another car gets underneath it. Who are these people? Do they live here? If so, they need to get their own security fob. If they don't live here, they shouldn't be in the parking garage. Last year I did overhear a very interesting conversation at the Concierge desk. Some guy came to the front desk wanting to know how to get to the parking garage because he \\\"followed his friends into the garage last night and parked in their space.\\\" When he was asked to name his \\\"friends\\\", he couldn't. The more likely scenario was that he was their \\\"dealer\\\" (and I don't mean blackjack).\\n\\n\\nAll in all, lately we are very disappointed with our quality of life here. We are great tenants, we always pay our rent on time, never cause any problems whatsoever, take great care of our unit and are respectful of everyone else here regardless of their own actions.

But, as we all know, it only takes one bad apple to ruin everything - and this one ruined my good streak.\\n\\nThe Cafe had come recommended and we were considering it for our monthly Meetup group breakfast so the hubs and I did our initial run.  We arrived at 740 on a Sunday morning after church and the place was nicely busy.  We had tried before to go there but the lines have always been too long so we were thrilled to finally be part of the in-crowd LOL  About 1/2 of the tables were taken in the main dining area, the side room empty, the bar about 1/2 full. So not so busy that we sat 10 minutes without any contact or water.  Rule number 1: greet them, get them a cuppa, apologize if you are busy.  Okay. I am going to give them a 2/5 on that. \\n\\nWe ordered simple - a veggie omelet for hubs and a 2 egg over easy breakfast for me. We got our meal 30 minutes - count it - 30 minutes later.  Not sure  - I think they had to go in back to the henhouse and wait for the eggs to be laid.  30 minutes on a not-so-busy morning.\\n\\nHubs omelet was fine. Chock full of pepper and onions, mushrooms, spinach, tomatoes.  It was a typical veggie omelet, nothing special.\\n\\nThe potatoes were uneven. They are steamed redskins that are them griddled which is not a bad way to make homefries (I like to boil then griddle but same idea). The thin slices were really good and crispy - my plate was dark and yummy. Hubs, however, had thick slices that did not look griddled at all - they looked like a pasty Pittsburgher transplanted to the Valley of the Sun LOL and they were hard in the middle meaning those guys needed a tad more cooking. \\n\\nToast should not be a big deal - but it was drenched in something other than butter.  Liquid gold? Melted margarine? And it is thick Texas break so when I say soaked.....\\n\\nMy eggs, however, were the Waterloo for the day. Sunnyside up is not a tough option for an experienced cook.  I grew up cooking them in a skillet as well as on the grill since busy breakfasts mean multiple orders at once. Anyway, they came back.... not even undercooked.  The area around the yolk - maybe 1\\\" in all directions - was clear. The eggs were not cooked.  Being the good girl I am, I didn't make a fuss - I asked the server if she would have the cook flip them on the grill and make them over easy - that was fine with me, I just could not eat raw whites.  When she brought it back, her comment was all I need to say \\\"I'm sorry. He would not flip them over, he tried to cook them more sunnyside up\\\" which resulted in eggs that were oddly bipolar - the edges were SO overcooked, they were brittle and curled up, the center was slightly more solid but still undone.  As a server, she should have not brought them out. She knew it. There was no use sending them back - one more time on the grill and i could take them home and use them as Frisbees for the pup.  When she came back for refills, she never said a word at the uneaten eggs on my plate.\\n\\nFinally when she brought back my credit card to sign, she said \\\"sorry about the eggs\\\". At that point, I was just ticked. I don't usually complain but I did. I say that the eggs were disgraceful, that the cook would allow them to go out like that and that she as a server should not have brought them out when he wouldn't remedy the situation. she said \\\"this is a family owned business, I can't tell the cook to do anything, they own this place\\\". Wow. Just wow. I come from a family-owned business and, as anyone that knows me knows, I try to  onlygo to family-owned non-francise businesses (except for Dairy Queen, but we all have vices....). If anything,those are the places where typically people/owners DO care about their business and their reputation.  So, Henhouse Cafe - which is it? Do you really not care - in which case, shame on you, lots of other good restaurants in the area?  Or do you care, in which case, you ought to reprimand or fire the server?  Either way, I think the breakfast club will not be stopping by anytime soon.....",

The shop is owned locally and operated by Family so immediatly you are greeted by the courteous hair dressers AND the Owner, which is a rare treat.  I was very nervous going in but my nerves were soon settled when I met what was to become my future Hair Dresser, Adrian.  This gentelman made me feel comfortable from the moment I sat in his chair.

        "sentence": "My husband and I went to NOCA for my birthday dinner on a Wednesday night.  We had heard really great things about it, and we were happy with our overall experience.   Here's how it was...\\n\\nFirst the Pros:\\nThe food and drinks were fantastic!  Seriously, delicious.   I had the Death's Door cocktail and my husband tried the Nocarita.  Both were awesome.  The Death's Door was a gin based drink (and I am not a fan of gin) that was perfectly balanced with just the right sweetness and alcohol-y goodness. YUM!  My husband's Nocarita was also quite tasty. I preferred my Death's Door, but that is a matter of personal taste I think. \\n\\nOur amuse bouche that night was a chilled pumpkin soup with hazelnut mascarpone served in a cute little espresso cup.  It made the perfect first impression of what was to come.  It was so flavorful, I could have had a gallon of it and been a happy lady.  They should put that soup as a regular menu item, because I would go back to NOCA just for that!\\n\\nFor apps, my husband had the Simple Salad that was perfectly dressed and had a thoughtful variety of ingredients that elevated the ubiquitous green salad to something unique.   I had the Bacon Chowder soup with Mussels that both tasted and smelled delicious.  So, so, so good! Some really nice ladies at the table next to us even commented on how good my soup smelled.  \\n\\nFor our main courses, I had the famous Lobsta Roll with Duck Fat Fries.  Oh my!  It lived up to the hype.  My sandwich was comprised of  big chunks of lobster dressed in a decadent creamy sauce, balanced with a slightly tangy corn and red pepper relish that perfectly complimented the lobster \\\"salad\\\".  It was all nestled in a buttery/toasty roll, with the fries and a dipping aioli sauce on the side.  The portion was perfect and satisfying.  Really, I can't say enough good things about my sandwich.  \\nMy husband had the Rotelle with sausage and Tuscan kale.  Again, it was delicious.  The pasta was perfectly cooked and the sausage and kale were a perfect compliment.  Sausage can sometimes be overpowering, but this wasn't at all.  It was mild and flavorful at the same time.  The pasta sauce was indescribably good.  It was buttery and savory, and did not over-saturate the pasta.  It was as perfect as a restaurant pasta dish can get! \\n\\nFor dessert, my husband had the donuts with three sweet dipping sauces, which were good.  I had the Nocabar, which I preferred to the donuts.  It was just the right size and tasted like a grown up version of a Twix bar on steroids.  The Nocabar was the perfect ending to my birthday meal and did not disappoint.  The grape flavored cotton candy was fun and a nice touch.  We had commercially bought and packaged chocolate mints for our parting \\\"gift\\\".  I think they ran out of the cellophane bagged house-made cookies that I saw people leaving with at the beginning of our meal.  \\n\\nOkay, now the Cons...\\n\\nThe service was not great.  It was okay, at best.  When we walked in there was not a host or hostess to greet us.  Instead, we stood awkwardly at the door for a good 5-10 minutes waiting to be recognized.  They were not that busy as it was a Wednesday night, which made it all the more frustrating.  When we finally did get greeted and seated, there was no apology for the wait (we did have a reservation).  Our server was nice, but not too attentive.  She seemed bored.  The course timing was paced appropriately and the bus boy did keep our water glasses filled.  Overall, we were certainly not impressed with the service.  I think NOCA needs to work on training their wait staff.  \\n\\nThe prices were high and did not match the level of service we received. I don't mind paying for a quality restaurant experience, but based on my experience at NOCA the service made our visit less than what it could've been...especially when we got  the final bill.    IMO, if you are going to charge the prices that were featured at NOCA both the service and the food needs to sing.  In this case, the food was worthy but the service was not.  \\n\\nOverall, I would go back to NOCA for the food.  If they stepped up their service, then NOCA would become one of my favorite spots. I asked my husband to rate our NOCA experience before writing this review and I think his description was perfect.  He said, \\\"The food was 4.5 rating out of 5...the service was a 3 out of 5 at best.\\\"  \\n\\n  As it stands, I have other places that I would want  to check out before going back to NOCA; places that have both their food AND service dialed in.   However, I think that if you haven't been to NOCA before it's worth a visit to check out the amazing food for yourself.",

I remember always enjoying the experience...\\n\\nNostalgia is better than reality.\\n\\nMy friend ordered the fettuccini alfredo and I went with the garlic mizithra...which is a twist on the standard mizithra cheese & spaghetti plate I typically order. This added garlic, mushrooms and bacon. The food was good, but fairly average. The portions were smaller than I remembered. \\n\\nThe sourdough bread was good - still warm. The restaurant opened in 1972 and I think they have been making salads the same way since Day 1. It was an iceberg lettuce classic and although I ordered blue cheese, it arrived with vinaigrette. Rather than send it back I kept the salad. \\n\\nPerhaps I arrived close to a shift change, but there appeared to be 2 managers on duty, both stopping by the table multiple times to ask \\\"is everything fantastic?\\\" - the waiter stopped by several times as well and said \\\"Is everything excellent?\\\" I like to be checked on occasionally, but too much is annoying.  \\n\\nAnother annoying aspect was the food had been on the table about 10 minutes and still was 3/4 full, the waiter came back and asked if we needed boxes or were we still working on it? Um...yes, still working.  Maybe it was because it was 5:30 and the lobby was crowded with others waiting, but I hadn't been there that long - and three minutes later when he popped back over and asked again if we were finished, well you just earned yourself a small tip and a long guest because my show didn't start for another 90 minutes and I didn't have anything to do. Deal with it. \\n\\nFinally I allowed him to take the plates away and we were brought complementary spumoni - I have to say that was the best part of the entire meal. Afterwards I swung by the restroom and that was a charming experience.  Big open urinals - at least it wasn't like the old pee troughs some places used to have - but there it was - a full restroom of guys looking like a locker room. I didn't know my spaghetti came with sausage. Yuck.\\n\\nOverall - $31 for a hopefully soon forgettable dining experience.  The service from the waiter and the manager(s) was annoying and the meal average at best.  Some memories are best kept as that. I don't think I need to revisit this restaurant any time soon.",

With that in mind, Best Buy should have brought people in from other areas to help. It was very frustrating to my older father who was there to trade in his phone with mine. The only reason I did not make a scene in the store was because of the associate who helped me. Wilbur is a great asset to the department. When he said hello, he immediately apologized for the long wait. We had come from a different store because your TERRIBLE website said you had the items we wanted were there. Well, guess what? YOU DIDN'T. So, we drove across town. The guy with the clipboard said he \\\"checked\\\" and the 3 phones we wanted were there. And when Wilbur checked, 2 out of the 3 weren't. This then upset my father so much, he had to leave the store and wait in the car.  Thankfully, Wilbur was able to find 2 out of the 3 phones we wanted and then able to give us a discount on another phone so he wouldn't be without a phone. Wilbur then finished the upgrade process to get us out there since we had been there for so long. The company is lucky that you have him. Will I ever shop at Best Buy again? ABSOLUTELY NOT.

My friend Lo had the sampler platter with baby back ribs, pulled chicken and bbq chicken. All were very tasty. Baby back ribs came right off the bone just the way I like it.

There was only one seat available, so being the gentleman that I am, I gave it to my wife and stood behind her. I'm pretty sure the two-top table 6.5 inches behind me were THRILLED at having a front row movie theater view of my butt while they attempted to enjoy dinner. Did I mention we had reservations, and still had this kind of wait? Unreal. \\n\\nWe continued our up-close-and-personal adventure with the rest of the restaurants patrons when we were finally seated at a table for two...5 inches from tables situated to the left and right.

Impromptu family-style dining, my wife and I joked later. \\n\\nThe food was OK, and the service was ok...especially considering how slammed this place was, and how the wait staff could hardly maneuver between the restaurants patrons, all packed like sardines. For my money, Greek Isles in Southend is a far better Greek and Mediterranean experience than this place.

Anything to make a few extra bucks, right?\\n\\nSecond, the layout on two holes is dangerous.  If you hit an errant drive on the 13th hole, it can very easily land on the 14th tee box.  And the 17th hole is placed such that a miss to the right can easily hit the 16th tee box, and a miss to the left can easily hit the 18th tee box.  You have to constantly be on the lookout on those last few holes.\\n\\nFinally, the clientele are a bunch of clowns.  Every time I play, there is a group behind or in front that causes problems (slow play, hitting into you, etc.).  Never had those problems elsewhere.  \\n\\nTrue story, we played this morning, and twice the group behind us hit into us.  On the 13th hole, I was standing no more than 250 yards from the tee, IN PLAIN VIEW, and I hear someone yell.  Someone's drive lands about ten feet from me and speeds right by.  Of course I turn around and stare the guy down, holding my club up in the air just to let him know that I'm not happy about this.  But I give him the benefit of the doubt...Maybe he didn't look at the GPS and thought I was farther out?  But then the last guy in the foursome hits his drive!  Of course it lands half way between me and one of the other guys in our group.  This guy just watched his colleague almost hit me, and he goes ahead and hits anyways!  One of the guys in our group kindly pointed out to the idiots that there are three groups right in front of us, and thus there is no hurry.  \\n\\nWe later mentioned this to one of the cart girls, who said these guys are out here every week!  How could they not have known the distance if they know the course?  Of course they knew, they just thought it was OK to hit into people as long as they yell \\\"fore.\\\"  On the 18th hole, unsurprisingly, the toolbags teed off while we were still hitting our second shots, and actually drove up within 30 yards of us while we were hitting.  I've never seen such terrible etiquette on a golf course before.\\n\\nSo between the uncaring staff, the dangerous layout, and the clowns who play here, there's no reason to play here when there are so many other great courses around.

I had YC's $10.50 large bowl at lunch. It's way bigger than their $9.50 small bowl - I don't know why anyone would purchase that. \\n\\nI agree with a lot of the other reviews - smashing down your frozen slices of meat is unappealing. They have about a dozen different sauce types, but you need to mix 5 of 6 for every recipe - it was confusing. And they had dry spices, but no advice on what goes well with what. I think the dry spices are new because the employees know very little about them, other than advising to use them sparingly. \\n\\nYou get a much bigger bowl than at Genghis, plus all the soup & rice you want, and your drink is included in the price. But with fewer ingredients and poor flavoring guidance, it may take several trips to YC's before you end up with a tasty meal. And the soup I had (they offer two types) was fairly bland. Whereas every meal I've had at Genghis has been delicious - I've been going there about once a month since first discovering it last year. It's like comparing fast food to real dining.",

Since it was directly across the street from Caesar's Palace we were super pumped for our weekend in Vegas.\\n\\nHowever, the first night while climbing into bed, I noticed that we didn't even have a fitted sheet on the bed.  It was just another top sheet that was folded under the mattress.  Okay - that's forgivable...it's kind of nasty but I can deal. \\n\\nThen, the next morning I hop in the shower to get ready for the day.  Water pressure?  Hardly any.  It took a good 3 minutes just to rinse the shampoo out of my hair.  And THEN the water went ICE FRIGGIN COLD.  Never even went back to hot!  Just went from a nice warm temp to ice cubes for no reason.  I never did get any hot water again and my poor husband was forced to shower in freezing water.  This happened the next day as well....we were so upset!\\n\\nAnother gripe?  The elevator.  It was the slowest elevator I've ever been on.  Seriously, we waited around 5-10 minutes every single time just for the elevator to get on our floor.  When it finaly did arrive, there was such a huge line of people to get on that everyone stuffed themselves in there and then it was just a slow-moving sweatbox until you got to your desired floor.\\n\\nThe final straw, though, came as we checked out of the hotel.

The chicken wraps tasted like frozen chicken wraps you can buy in the grocery store.   \\n\\nMy husband and I both ordered the same entree, ribeye  steak and loaded baked potato and salad. The salad was just okay. Iceberg lettuce, a couple of cucumber slices, one small cherry tomato, and red onion with croutons. \\n\\nThe steaks came and we had order medium well. A hunk of fat the size of a half dollar took up the center while oozing blood seeped out. This was not medium well, more like medium or medium rare.

No cheese? no chives? \\n\\nHusband's steak and potato was the same. \\nI had had a wonderful day and did not want to end it with complaining about dinner, so we ate what we could.

Then again, I'm a middle-aged white yankee woman.\\n\\nBut.. I have a Southern-Fried husband who wanted to try it and we were in the neighborhood after getting my car checked at the shop.. pulled into the strip mall where House of Flavor is located and there weren't any lines... a good sign, in my opinion.  To me, it meant that Flava wasn't in the house so we could actually just get the food and not be involved in any celebrity-worshipping circus.  \\n\\nI'll admit, I was a bit dubious when a man unlocked the door to let us in, then locked the door behind us.  He was the \\\"doorman\\\" for a take-out chicken joint?

I got the small fried chicken meal (2 pieces, 2 sides, 1 drink) and hubby got the large meal (4 pieces, 2 sides, 1 drink).  It took a while for our food to be ready and, when our order was up, we were asked if all white meat was fine.  It wasn't, but I wasn't about to wait any longer (I kept eyeing the large windows and the locked door with unease).

The chicken was fantastic - very flavorful and moist, and not greasy at all.  Whenever hubby hauls me out for fried chicken, I eat one piece of it (at most) and that's under duress.  This, I'll travel back across town for again.  I ate both of my pieces of chicken and might have eaten more if it had been there!\\n\\nThe sides we both got were cole slaw and the mac & cheese.  The cole slaw was initially boring, I thought it could have used some vinegar.. but it oddly grew on me after I ate more of it and, by the end, I really liked it.  The mac & cheese was too cold for me, so it's in the fridge for reheating later.  We both got sweet tea for our drinks because hubby loves the stuff, he drank both of them up and said it was pretty good..

After a comedy of errors in both booking the rooms and staying at the hotel, I sent the below (abridged) complaint to the Holiday Inn national management:\\n\\n**********************\\nI have never experienced the sheer lack of service as I did recently at the Holiday Inn Express South Side Pittsburgh.  \\n \\n\\nReservations and Payment: I booked a group of 8 rooms for four days.  I needed an invoice or confirmation with the entire cost of the rooms in order to have my organization write a check for the total cost. I was told that the manager of the hotel was the only person who could provide me with this documention.  Over the three weeks preceding the stay, I left no less than 9 voicemails for the manager. Each voicemail provided my name, email address, cell phone number, confirmation code, and a clear explanation of what I needed and why.  On one of my repeated calls, I did finally manage to get the assistant manager on the phone; he promised to send me the required information immediately.  I finally received the invoice a week later after an additional two voicemails; unfortunately, it indicated that the entire cost for the block of 8 rooms for four nights was approximately $1,500. I immediately replied to the email asking for the correct amount (a total that exceeded 5,000). I never received a reply to this email. \\n \\n\\nI called the hotel five days before the group checked in so as to have each individual's name on the reservation so that they could check in easily. I spent 45 minutes on the phone with the very polite front desk person, painstakingly giving each name, receiving confirmation numbers for each guest, and going over the payment plan in detail.  Upon checking into the hotel, none of the guests were able to use the confirmation numbers I provided them, nor were any of the rooms in their name. Upon checking out, it was established that half of the rooms were charged to each individual's credit card rather than taken from either the corporate card I used to pre-pay the rooms with, or the large check I brought with me.  Upon trying to remedy this, I spent another 20 minutes with a very polite and helpful front desk clerk, only to find that not only were the majority of the rooms charged to individual cards, but that they couldn't even find one of the reservations.   \\n\\nService: Upon checking in, one guest discovered that the couch in his room had been vomited on by the previous guest.  When he went to the front desk, he was told that there had been a sports event the previous night, and that someone would eventually be up to clean the couch.  Upon arriving back at his room the next night, he found that \\\"cleaning up\\\" apparently meant reversing the couch cushion. He was never offered an alternate room, nor was the mess ever taken care of properly.  Three of the guests did not receive maid service for three of the four days. They did not have \\\"do not disturb\\\" signs on their doors, and when they specifically requested service, it was not delivered.\\n*****************************\\n I received a standard form response to this, which didn't address any of my actual complaints but promised to have the specific hotel contact me within 48 hours to further discuss this matter.  Needless to say, I've not hear back from them.\\n\\nIt's a shame since the actual property is pretty nice.

But instead of just putting a bike rack out front you have to have them built into the shape of bicycles, then painted bright neon colors so that from afar way off people can see, \\\"ooh this is cool place to ride bikes too.\\\" I feel like puking even thinking about them. \\n\\nThe food: Neo Asian fusion with bits of Sushi inspired by Japan, Korean food, and some obvious Thai choices. The problem here again is its so obvious. People that love thai food, I mean really love it don't get Pad Thai! People that love Korean food, like really love it don't get Steak and Broccoli, and people that love Sushi don't American Rainbow Rolls.\\n\\nSo if you're visiting do not sold on the location, use Yelp to help you find some real gold mines in fabulous downtown Phoenix, there are plenty, but skip this joint just like I will be forever as well.",

Sitting at the bar with the ability to glance out at the water was to imagine being in coastal France. Even though this isn't really a French restaurant, it is French-inspired and that inspiration extends very strongly into the aesthetics, including the music. Just trust me, though- the bar is where it's at. Beautiful zinc top, white subway tile, a very cordial bar staff and then there is the menu. I had the Provencal drink, which consists of vodka, lavender, lemon and sparkling wine. You would really be hard pressed to find a more summery, dreamy drink, which, of course, was perfectly executed. The food menu for the bar is comprehensive but somehow appropriate and the quality and quantity make every selection a great value. We went on a Sunday, so the specials did not apply. However, the prices were still more than reasonable. The Sardine version of a hot dog is $7 and everyone in my party agreed it was not your average dog. My sandwich was salmon, so a bit more pricey but well worth it. And every sandwich comes with their amazing frites and a generous helping of mixed greens. The salmon sandwich is served on toasted sourdough with an olive tapenade. It was really my dream sandwich.

The only reason I gave them 2 stars was because the coffee tasted good despite it having contaminated ice (hope I don't get sick). \\n\\nSo this is what happened for those curious:\\n\\nI walked in and sat down. The girl working, who looked extremely hungover, did not greet me or say any word to me as i looked at the menu. She just stood there until I asked for something. I ordered a coffee and a crepe. While she was making my coffee, she scooped the ice out of a dingy looking ice container and just dropped the scoop back in. She did this multiple times while I was there. The germs from her hand  were all over the ice and in everyone's drinks...\\n\\nThen, she kept wiping down all the counters with the SAME dirty rag over and over again. And after she got done \\\"wiping\\\" (or spreading everything) on the counter, a guy that was working, not sure if it was the owner or not, decides to start making some drinks for people after being outside, without washing his hands. He picked up a clean spoon to mix in caramel in some coffee and threw the spoon down on the counter right in front of me. Then, when he was making another drink, he picked up the SAME spoon from the dirty counter and used it to mix someone else's drink. He was very sloppy making the drinks, which doesn't bother me until you get unsanitary with it. I am very concerned nothing is cleaned properly just by their behavior, including the bucket of ice the girl brought in to refill the ice container. I am sure this place isn't the only one that does this stuff but having it happen all in front of you is a whole other experience.\\n\\nI was not able to really enjoy my crepe because I was too focused on all this going down, so I will not write a review on the food.

Actually the chili was inside the burrito, so I'm completely not understanding the sausage (I substituted bacon).  And there was no shredded cheese on top, instead it  was their jalapeno cheese sauce.  I liked the sauce, but I think a dish ought to be prepared as described on the menu.  But the problem again was that it was salty to the point that a lesser eater would not have gotten it down.  Upon tasting the components, hash browns really salty.  Bacon exceptionally salty, even for bacon.  Green chili over the top salty.  Had this been served alone, I would have actually sent it back and ordered something else, and that's something I never do.  But I had a $20 gift certificate, so I didn't complain since we were really only paying for drinks.\\n\\nFor the good.  The menu is perfect in my book for breakfast with a nice combination of savory and sweet dishes, and some southwest items tossed in the mix.  The lemon ricotta pancakes almost had me, and I would still love to try them.  The service was excellent.  All the staff was friendly.  Our server was attentive.  You couldn't ask for more there.   And the prices are really good.  Most breakfast dishes $7-$8, nothing over $9.  I just don't know that I want to consume a week's worth of sodium in one meal again.  But I might be persuaded to come back for dinner when there might be another chef.",

I was a fine art photography major in college, and for a few years worked as a professional wedding and portrait photographer. I have a pretty deep love not just for photography but for the history of photography and the Polaroid product in particular. \\n\\nHaving said that - this is one of my new favorite places! Polaroid needed to do *something* to make themselves relevant, and this is it. The ability to print mounted keepsake photos from your phone instantly is great. The offer of purchasing specifically designed frames for your small or medium mounted prints in the style of old Polaroids is unique and clever. The entire staff in the store were very friendly and helpful. The actual prints themselves came out very nicely. Plus, you can order any of the products you see in store or prints online - so, instead of lugging large prints around the strip, I opted to visit the website from home. The quality of bamboo, metal, and lucite-mounted prints was higher than I anticipated. You can get high quality prints here without needing a professional lab connection. (I'm pretty darn picky about print quality, and I would recommend the prints to anyone.)\\n\\nI didn't pay the $5 to visit the museum, mostly because having been a fine art/photography major, I was fairly confident I already have a good grasp on the history of photography and have been to my fair share of art museums.

More on that in a bit. But when you walk into a particular Starbucks and the baristas not only know what you favor every day - in my case, a grande Misto w/non-fat milk - but also have it ready before you reach the wait counter.\\n\\nThe great news about this location is the recent renovation, which sucked for me considering I was without a workday coffee fix for exactly 10 business days, and when you have to rely on that shitty-assed Keurig-brewed coffee I have to endure at home, or force yourself to walk from Gateway to N. Tryon on a spectacularly and stupidly hot afternoon, which, by the way, I'd rather suck on a wet and frayed towel than have to walk 6 city blocks in 95-degree weather just for a delicious cup of coffee...oh shit, where was I? The renovation, right. The biggest complaint was the lack of space at this location, and when folks were getting their fix between 8-10am and 2-4pm, you know this spot would get crazy crowded, and you really couldn't move around without accidently brushing someone's ass, and then have to wait for some slow poke to finish languidly stirring their mocha choca latta yay extra soy 5-pump coffee, it got pretty frustration. Thankfully, the renovation has not just created a better use of space - there's a nice and cozy sitting spot in the back - but it's even cheerful-looking, in a rustic sort of way. \\n\\nAnd then there's Sarah, the shift manager, a pint-sized, smart-ass (I love smart-asses) that runs a tight ship but makes everyone feel like they're the most important customer ever.

When the pizza's arrived the cheese pizza looked like they stored the box on its side on the way here. We decided lets make the best of it and tried to redistribute the cheese. When we went to pull a slice on both pizza's the cheese was 1/2 inch thick and was like a brick. Underneath the pizza dough was BARELY cooked and was unable to withstand the weight of itself let alone the heaping amount of cheese they haphazardly thrown on. When we bit into it we confirmed that the pizza was under-cooked. We have to wait for 45-55 minutes for delivery which to me means they are taking the time to cook the pizza but apparently not. We have experienced these same issues before with streets and put up with it due to the limited restaurants that deliver in our area. My husband is currently returning the remaining pizza to the restaurant, I should have pulled the slices we couldn't stomach out of the trash and send that back with it. For their higher prices this should be the best dang pizza in the area. Unfortunately, Domino's puts out a way better $5 pizza, which isn't saying much. These folks need to get there act together and stop treating there food with no care. It makes me wonder, do they not care due to the lack of options in our area so they feel they can do whatever they want? Well we will not be taken advantage of any longer. Adios Streets of New York, I will now happily suit up and drive the 12 miles and spend our hard earned money at Oregano's or Barro's, where they will provide us with a fully cooked pizza.\\n\\n*Update..... my husband has come home and told me they stated \\\"We have been having problems in the kitchen all day\\\". WHAT!?!? How is that acceptable? If you have been having issues ALL day then, as any good business management would do, it should be fixed by now. If you cant fix it stop selling that product. If its your staff, give them the training and hold them accountable. If they cant do the job get someone who can in place.This should be a business dedicated to its customer satisfaction,  and being a supervisor myself, i wouldn't expect anything less than the best of my product and my team. As i said earlier in my review that this has happened before (more times than not) and per other reviews I see its a consistent message. Don't give a line of bull, own your problems and fix them. Also when they refunded the $47 dollars we spent on two medium pizza's (CRAZY PRICE, I KNOW), she I feel didn't know how to properly refund. She as a manager advised my husband that she doesn't use that machine much so doesn't know how to operate it. So, there multiple subtractions and additions on a receipt of 4,700.00 (WHAT!?!?!) then multiple subtractions and additions of other amounts.

It's hard to explain.  The patrons were mostly middle aged men and a couple of women.  We sat at the bar and were basically ignored for the first five minutes we were there while the bartender (picture Johnny Bravo from the cartoon network) talked on his cell phone, flirted with the female patron(s), and wiped down the glasses.  We were finally served by a really nice lady who appeared from the back of the restaurant and we were promptly served.  My wife had a Guinness and I had a Crown and Coke.  The pour was strong and the total was $11.  We noticed a sign proclaiming karaoke Wed-Sat from 9pm-1:30am.  We spied the karaoke setup in the corner and grabbed a book and saw they had a pretty decent selection of songs, so we decided to stop back by after our engagement and check it out.\\n\\nLater that night, we returned, and karaoke was in full swing...well sorta.  There were two singers.  The host was doing his best to get other singers up, but just wasn't having much luck.  In between singers he played a mix of Lady Gaga and Kid Rock so it wasn't quite as awkward, although it was rather loud.  We were hungry so we ordered some food.  I got the sliders and my wife had the crab rangoon appetizer.  I didn't try the rangoon, but the sliders were fair.  The sliders consisted of basically a hamburger patty cut into quarters with cheese and grilled onions on top.  It was dark and I didn't notice the grilled onions when I read the menu or I would have declined as they don't agree with me.  But that was my fault not theirs.

It just happened that we decided to spend a couple of nights here before we check in to an extended stay hotel in Las Vegas during our recent move from TX. So my mom was craving some good Filipino food near the end of our road trip. Fiesta Filipina was the closest to the hotel so there we went. \\n\\nThe place was a decent size if you compare it to a typical \\\"turo-turo\\\" restaurant. Plenty of chairs and a couple of TVs were seen airing local Philippine news and soap operas. Nice inviting traditional decor. Plenty of parking as well. The staff behind the counter greeted us with warm smiles and asked us what we want in rapid fire Tagalog. I can understand why non-Filipinos can be a bit intimidated upon entering the premises. There was a Caucasian couple behind us who couldn't decide what they want right away, and the staff quickly shifted gears to explain the dishes as best as they can. \\n\\n(On that note: I can't understand why they don't provide a sign next to the dish so it'll save them the time and trouble explaining things to those who are unfamiliar with Filipino food? I've lived in California for nearly 8 years and nobody ever does this! A simple index card with basic ingredients can be a quick solution)\\n\\nLet's move on to the food.\\nCrispy pata (roasted pig) - flavorful, crispy, delicious.This is a good dish to share with a group of people. \\nPansit (rice stick noodles w/ pork belly strips, veggies, and shrimp) - good flavor, the veggies were not soggy and just enough saltiness\\nDinuguan (pork blood stew) - I don't eat this but my husband had rave reviews.\\nPork/Chicken BBQ skewers - great flavor w/ good amount of meat on the sticks\\nLumpia (fried pork spring rolls) - decent, only because my husband makes the best homemade lumpias :-)\\nSinigang (tamarind soup) - above average; sour enough with generous servings of (your choice of fish or meat here)\\nGinisang Munggo (sauteed mung beans w/ pork belly & other veggies) - yummy!\\nKare-kare (oxtail soup w/ peanut sauce) - very good\\n\\nThe prices are more than fair. We recently brought our aunt and her friends here visiting from Maryland and for a group of 10 people you can expect to pay $120 including drinks with plenty of leftovers to take home. If you liked the soups, you can always ask them for a complimentary second serving (without the meat) just like we do in the Philippines (\\\"Kuya, pahingi pa po ng sabaw!\\\"). I thought the overall ambiance was excellent, and they checked in on us once or twice to see how everything was. There is also a pastry/bread cart by the entrance where you can try various sweets such as pastillas (sweet milk candies), polvoron, mamon (french sponge cake) and yema. \\n\\nIf someone would ask me where to go for a taste of good Filipino cuisine, I would not hesitate one bit to point them to Fiesta Filipina.

The woman that answered the phone was deeply confused. A tray of rigatoni/meatballs, a pasta/chicken & a pasta/shrimp parm order. I really thought that was a simple order, right? Is it me? Lol .. She kept repeating herself, but with every word she complicated my order further. All I asked for was to put one chicken cutlet aside (sans cheese because of a dairy allergy). She wanted to send the pasta, sauce, chicken, shrimp and pasta in all separate containers. That would just waste their time and extra containers for nothing! I was in upper restaurant management for years, they should appreciate small/simple orders. With every minute, it deepened our frustration, but we tried to keep patient for the sake of our dinner. \\n\\nOnce my husband arrived home with the food, we started opening the trays and (not) to our surprise, it appeared to be missing 2 of the 3 items we ordered.

Really?! :-/ I SOOOO wanted to love this place since I'm an all italian- born and raised- in Brooklyn New Yorker!! \\n\\nI called the restaurant (super annoyed) and asked how it was even possible to forget anything after a 9 minute call?.. I didn't get an apology or so much as an explanation. I got attitude and a \\\"well your husband probably just left it here\\\" and hung up on me!!!!!! I called back and got an automated message saying the restaurant was closed for the day... Nice. \\n\\nMeanwhile, my husband was driving back there to get our missing food. When he arrived, the old miserable woman that hung up on me told him he didn't forget anything and that the chicken and shrimp was UNDER the pasta. WTF is this the twilight zone?? He thought she was kidding. Knowing we would NEVER go there again, he just drove back home. On his way, he called me and told me where I can find the mystery food items lol ..... My mom & I dumped the tins of pasta into a bowl and found lumps of what they considered chicken and shrimp parm. Just wow. My pictures will say it all. The bottom of the tin was filled with water, soggy, overcooked pasta & undercooked breading on both the chicken and shrimp. The meatballs were pale, FLAT and bread colored! They were probably 70%+ filler. They were so mushy, they were spreadable *barf* \\n\\nAs an Italian, I've never seen or even heard of any parm platter, with the protein UNDER the pasta!! Or meatless mestballs! It was so messy and watery :-( such a shame and waste of food. \\n\\nWell, I had hungry company so we figured we'd try it. Not even one of the 8 people at the table could even get to their 2nd bite. Even my 5 year old's reaction was \\\"ew!\\\" \\n\\nTo end our night, my husband woke up in the middle of the night really sick. \\n\\nThanks for the \\\"Authentic Italian\\\" lololol \\n\\nAvoid this place at all costs! \\n\\nOh, and if you'd like to refund me my $80, feel free!

Well it was close enough, so I let it slide.  \\n\\nI'm from southern California, so planning my trial was set around me actually being in Vegas.

They picked up and was like, well we were early and waited for you and you didnt show, so we are leaving now.  So I responded with, ok who do I call to cancel my appointment in November?  When I mentioned that, they said they can make something work for my engagement photos and come back up to do my hair.  \\n\\nAt the end of the day, I never got an actual trial for the day of hair.  We rescheduled for the next day, Sunday, and she promised to send me someone who was also going to be working with me on my wedding day.

At this point, I'm less than a 6 weeks from my wedding.  I was not about to put up with this stuff.  I left something like 4 or 5 message.  I finally got someone to pick up on Friday.  I was then notified that a) I was on the list of calls to return and b) the sister had hurt her back and was unable to come to SoCal.  Once again- no call to let me know ahead of time.  While I had her on the phone, I explained that I was done and she can cancel my appointment on the day of my wedding and if she was any kind of decent business person, she would refund my $150 deposit.

She said she will confirm with her sister.  A couple of days later, I get an email saying, nope, I got my trial and so, no refund and we are still good to go for 11.11.11.

I had the The house special Pho which was pretty much the everything bowl and the order of spring rolls.\\n\\nCons: Broth is not hot enough, combined with the fact that the noodles are not cooked in advanced and relies on the broth to cook it the noodles end up al dente. The fist warning I got when seated was that there is fish sauce on the table which is something you should not see, I mentioned to my friend that the only reason they would need that on the table is if someone asked for it because the broth is bland and sure enough the broth was bland and I needed to add fish sauce. Unlike hot sauce or the hoison sauce, this is a key ingredient to making the broth and is not something you should have to use as a season to liking. I ordered in Vietnamese and the waiter looked at me and asked me what number it was. It is important to have your waiters know the names of the dishes they are serving especially if you are claiming to be authentic. It left me wondering if someone new to the cuisine ask the waiter what they suggested would be steered in the wrong direction and leaving them completely turned off to this type of cuisine. The spring rolls were over bloated with noodles and drowning out the taste of any other items in the roll and the peanut saace was bland and lacking.\\n\\nPros: Service was prompt and they check up on you making sure drinks are refilled.\\n as far as price goes they are ok compared to others. They are not sparse on the meat. Plenty of meat which is a good thing and they seemed to have more tripe and tendon. Maybe they put a lot because not too many of their customers order these ingredients ( I had the everything bowl). Atmosphere and ambiance of the place is great felt a little more Japanese / Chinese but most pho places are dive joints anyways. \\n\\nOverall lasting impressions: I will not be going here again. I like my meat rare so it was fine for me but to most people the broth was not hot enough leaving the rare beef to be really pink and would gross most people out. On top of that the broth cooks the noodles as well since the broth is not really hot the noodles were not cooked all the way through. Al dente rice noodles really upset mine and my friends stomach. As mentioned before I worry that people will go here and being turned off to the whole vietnamese cuisine because they are taking the places claim to being authentic or misguided by the staffs lack of knowledge of the cuisine.\\n\\nSuggestions to place: Cook noodles separately just before preparing the bowl, make broth at a higher temperature, add more seasoning in broth as it is cooking. educate the the staff on the dishes.",

Their happy hour is very good, it includes one special drink of the week (this week was a vodka based bramble with blackberry) for 6$ and a page of their 'market' cocktails for 6$ ( these include your choice of fruit in a caipirinha, collins, frozen marg, or mojito).

I started with their lemongrass collins (not on HH, but it had ginger so I had to try it... 10$) - this is a solid drink. It is humongously large, gingery and fresh tasting. I was a fan. The husband got the white russian (which, like all of their classic cocktails can be made at 3 levels of booze quality - economy (10$), business class (or something else clever?) (12$), and first class (or something) (16$). He had the basic, and he liked it, but it wasn't his favorite russian ever. Anyway, then I had the special bramble (HH - 6$) - so delicious. I would definitely get this again. Then, against my better judgment, I ordered the tiramisu martini (12$). This thing was like dessert... chocolatey and creamy from the use of mascarpone cheese with a slight coffee and, of course, booze flavors... it was good stuff. At this point, I had certainly had enough and was feeling just fine. We left after paying our bill of about 40$... 40$ for 5 drinks is not bad guys... especially for hand crafted specialty cocktails. This is not your typical neighborhood bar, this is not applebees or wherever... it is not outrageous to ask 10$ for a drink. I encourage you to check this lovely new bar out, I will certainly be back!\\n\\nPS I have now been back every week for like 2 months.... the cocktails of the week have been generally successful, with my favorites being the strawberry lemonade cocktail and the orange concoction... so good and dangerous...

My boyfriend and I both ordered Tonkotsu-Shoyu but I opted for chijire men (thick, wavy noodles) and it was awesome! The noodles had great consistency and the soup was spot on.\\n\\n+Their 6 piece gyoza tasted like legit ramen shop gyozas. Yum!\\n\\n\\n-Limited seatings. There are four desks that seats four people, one desk that seats two people, and 9 seats available at the counter.\\n\\n-Line forms even before opening! My boyfriend and I got to Monta a little too early around 11AM. We were waiting in the car and people started trickling in around 11:15AM and there was mini line formed already before opening! Since it's limited seating, the people in line will fill up the restaurant and there will be constant flow of customers/wait time during lunch peak hours.\\n\\n-I read someone's review that they had great fried rice so I ordered it but it was a-okay. I've had better ramen shop fried rice before so I will not order it again if I visit Monta.\\n\\nMonta needs to definitely open a shop in LA. Cannot wait to eat Monta until my next visit to Vegas!",

The little foyer area as you enter the room is tiled and connects you to the amazingly large bathroom with stand in shower and large granite top vanity.  The closet located just outside of the bathroom is a little small, it can hang maybe about 6-8 items perfectly.  The bedroom area was great and well decorated.  IMO, I think the interior designer of this hotel must really like DWR, Z Gallerie and those type of furnishings.\\n\\nEach morning, they host a complimentary breakfast, which is really an upgraded continental.  I wasn't a fan of it but, no complaints really since it's complimentary.  They had your basic breads, bagels, muffins, danishes, cereals, fruit, make your waffle, eggs and one meat, coffee, juice, milk and tea.  The bread products were cold and when the hostess would replenish them, they literally were just out of the freezer.  The coffee wasn't the greatest but had caffeine which is all that mattered to me.  One day they had a ham and scrambled egg mixture going on, which was tasty but the next day, it was dried scrambled eggs and paper thin bacon on the side.  Again, it's complimentary, it's not designed to satisfy your morning appetite, much less your palate, but, it'll get you through the morning.  We ended up only eating there the first 2-mornings out of the 5-mornings we were there.\\n\\nOkay so it's going from excellent to good to bad, it eventually had to happen.  The hotel is literally next to the runway of LAS.  You can see the runway, from our room at least.  You don't hear the planes landing as much as you hear and feel the thunder of the planes taking off.  The first night, I literally woke up to the rumble of a plane taking off at 12:40am, probably because our window was vibrating.  No kidding!  We asked the front desk agent the next morning, who BTW wasn't all that pleasant, but seemed like she had a scripted answer to the ever popular question.  We were unpacked anyway and didn't want to move so we just went to CVS and bought ear plugs, which DID help.  However, we were in an odd number room, facing the back.  I have a feeling if you got an even number room, facing the front, the noise isn't as significant.  Not sure why the front desk agent wasn't so proactive in trying to make us happy, the hotel wasn't full or anything the whole time we were there.\\n\\nOverall, it's a nicely furnished hotel.  The service might be a little iffy.  But it's just too close to the runway for me to comfortably stay there again.

On our last night, we wrapped up our conference and headed out to American Fish.  \\nThis restaurant is nothing near the enjoyable experiences we had at the previous Michael Mina restaurants.  \\nThe hostess was very nice and welcomed us.  We went to the bar for a few drinks.  After being shunned by the bartender for twenty minutes we asked to be seated.  Apparently the bartender was two busy taking care of his 5 friends, than to tend to us. \\nAt the table it took some 15 minutes for our server to finally bring us menus.  It took another 15 minutes for bread and water.  After another 15 minutes our server takes our order.  \\nOur first course came out in a reasonable amount of time.  My friend had a salad, I had the tuna tartare.  At this point we were starving.  My friends salad looked like they dumped a ton of dressing on it, but she said it was fine.  I had such high expectations for the tuna tartare.  The previous Michael Mina restaurants delivered such delicious flavors, and with the name American Fish I would expect even better tuna tartare.  My first bite was enough.  The tartare was bland and the texture was mushy.  I had my friend try it and she had a look on her face that said yuck.  I didn't eat more than two bites out of it.  We called the server over, but she got called over by the table next to us and they didn't like what they had been served.  By the time she got back, I let her know that I wasn't too happy with the tartare and we were done with the first course.\\nNow on to the main course, we both ordered Lobster Wellington.  It was the most expensive item on the menu and we were looking forward to it.  When it was ready, the server made a big show of it before taking it to the back to be carved.  After our plates were in front of us, we looked forward to a good meal.  Once again, the first bite says it all.  The lobster was rubbery.  The flavor of it tasted like bad sea water.  We tried all the side dishes that came with it and they were just as bad.  The potatoes were rock hard and the spinach was bitter.  I quickly called our server over and asked for our check.  I didn't want to make a scene, so I asked if we could pay.\\nShe called the manager over and they offered us some complimentary dessert.  Now I ask you, if you've been served a bad appetizer and a bad main dish, why would you want to try another dish from the same restaurant????  The manager said we should have let them know the food wasn't very good.  I think I did when I said I wanted to pay my check and the food in front of me is barely touched.  In the end, the manager only charged us for the drinks.  I recommend you stay away from American Fish if you are a Michael Mina fan.  His other restaurants on the Vegas strip are better examples of his work.  If you're going to charge the same prices as the other Michael MIna restaurants, then I expect the same quality.    American Fish is just an insult to Michael MIna's name.  If you don't believe me, go look at the menu, the Lobster Wellington has been removed.",

We really just can't get enough of Kaskade. \\n\\nThe first of the two shows took place at Marquee Dayclub, where we had no problems at all as far as finding the correct line to check-in and claim our wristbands at. The girl who put our wristbands on even went so far as to cheerfully make sure that they weren't too tight on us - a gesture of kindness that I don't witness too often in the clubbing scene.\\n\\nI've learned some handy tips for those not familiar with Marquee Dayclub: \\n\\n- I'd advise getting to Marquee Dayclub early - that's your best bet for getting a pool towel to use. That towel, in turn, will allow you to stake your claim somewhere near the pool area (assuming you don't have a chair/cabana on deck, of course). We had little trouble getting a great spot near the main Dayclub pool, being that we arrived at around 12:30 PM or so. This being said, we may have arrived at this day party a bit too early - Kaskade didnt come on until almost three-and-a-half hours after we arrived (although Amtrac had the party rocking all day long!).\\n\\n- Free water is provided for on both sides of the bar towards the back of the venue, behind the DJ decks. It's got hints of cucumber and is consistently nice and chilled (and never empty), so you've simply got no excuse for paying for bottles of Voss water other than for the sake of looking bougey. \\n\\n- There are blackjack tables at the ready, all prepped to take advantage of drunken passerby. My advice - don't be that guy. I didn't see a single soul walk away from that table with any look on his face (only the fellas bought the bait) other than that of complete and utter defeat. \\n\\nOne rather sketchy transaction took place after the lady and I bought a Daiquiri from the bar stationed at the back of the Dayclub. My girlfriend paid with a $100 bill, and it was a good thing I went through the trouble of counting our change back - our bartender shorted us on change by twenty bucks! You would think that it's a common practice for someone working in food/beverage service to count cash back for a customer (especially with larger denominations), but this server made no effort at all to do so. Of course, after her mistake was identified, our bikini-clad bartender was happy to correct things (\\\"Oh, I'm so sorry, sweetie!\\\"), but I was still suspicious. Frankly, I wouldn't have been surprised if she would've contested this claim, had we not caught it right then and there. \\n\\nOn the flip side of things, the overall vibe of Marquee Dayclub is laidback, sexy, and irresistibly fun. For me, dayclubbing doesn't exude as much of a pretentious sort of vibe as nightclubbing does, and this was certainly echoed at Marquee. From the group of Asian girls proudly parading around with a massive Kaskade cutout head (which they were repeatedly lending out to other groups of attendees for photo ops!), to the group of gay guys that couldn't stop complimenting my girlfriend and I on how great we looked with one another, the place was filled with folks who just wanted to have fun and take in the experience of a complete departure from the real world. \\n\\nCoolest of all were the lucky partiers who had booked VIP cabanas that day; in addition to spraying the crowd with bottle upon bottle of Cliquot (we're talking like a college tuition's worth in champagne here, folks), the dayclubbers in one premium cabana kept providing my girl and I with free Heinekens - all in all, I must have anywhere from $30-40 thanks to their generosity! I felt like I was on the set of an episode of \\\"Entourage,\\\" or something to that effect. Needless to say, the crowd at Marquee Dayclub made the \\\"Summer Lovin'\\\" feeling seem all the more real for us. \\n\\nSpeaking of, Kaskade himself delivered a set that was perfectly geared for a hot Las Vegas day. While it wasn't as diverse as his Marquee Nightclub set later that night (review coming soon!), I nonetheless enjoyed his mix of melodic build-ups and electro house breakdowns. Per usual, everyone's favorite funky Mormon DJ exceeded expectations. \\n\\nNeedless to say, Marquee Dayclub was a bit of a departure of the norm for me. The Dayclub bug has bitten me, and I'm downright addicted.  \\n\\n(After a quick power nap, and with hangovers still in tow, my girlfriend and I made our way to Marquee Nightclub later that evening...but it looks like I'll just have to fill you all in on that next time!)",

Because of the location, this place should be an absolute \\\"goldmine\\\"  but it is really just.......meh",

        "sentence": "Terrible customer service. First off, my friend and I walk in and were just stared at for a bit before we got a curt, \\\"Hi\\\" from one of the employees. The woman who made our sandwiches was not nice at all. It seemed like we were bothering her by being there and having her do what she gets paid to do. She didn't ask if I wanted the oil, vinegar and seasonings, she just assumed I was done with my sandwich, and when I asked her to put them on she seemed irritated by it. There was another guy helping us and he was a tad nicer but didn't make much of an impression either. I work in the food service industry and know this is NOT how you treat customers.",

The couple of times I did get an ad in the mail they didn't have the coupons in it! They also got rid of their clearance section that I loved. I hope that it's just due to a slow transition.",

The portions are huge, the prices are great, and the sandwiches are tasty.  I usually go with the Cram-slam club but have tried a few others without disappointment.  The place is usually quiet and very casual.",
